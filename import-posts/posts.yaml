    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During July, our work was supported by <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>, <a href="http://www.cloudcity.io">Cloud City Development</a>, <a href="https://reinteractive.com/">reinteractive</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>In July, Ruby Together was supported by 74 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. In total, we were supported by 79 individual members and 66 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible!</p>

    <p>The Ruby Together Board of Directors met, and was able to finalize and ratify a plan for a new Ruby open source mentorship program called RubyMe–stay tuned for an official announcement with more details!</p>

    <p>In community news, Developer Evangelist <a href="https://twitter.com/aspleenic">PJ Hagerty</a> continued to spread the word about Ruby Together at RubyConf Kenya. Our Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students made progress on the <code>bundle change</code> feature, and they also worked on a comment that rewrites a Gemfile into a canonical form. And <a href="https://twitter.com/kerrizor">Kerri Miller</a> addressed outstanding issues in the RubyGems and RubyGems.org support queues.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>We released Bundler 1.16.3 on July 17. The new release includes support for the upcoming Ruby 2.6, and fixes several bugs including symlink handling, temporary file handling, and improving error messages around filesystem access and installation errors.</p>

    <p>Since we announced the new RFC process last month, we’ve seen new comments and new proposals in the <a href="https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/pulls">Bundler RFC repo</a>. If you’re interested in ideas for the future of Bundler, definitely take a look. Keep the comments and suggestions coming!</p>

    <p>In other exciting news, we added a new contributor to the core team. Welcome <a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez">David Rodríguez</a> to Bundler! :tada: Probably best known for his work on the <code>byebug</code> debugger gem, David was the driver behind updating gem templates to check in lockfiles, as well as work around ensuring that Bundler 2 will work on existing applications when it is released.</p>

    <p>This month, Bundler gained 63 new commits, contributed by 8 authors. There were 1,442 additions and 72 deletions across 33 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>In July, we updated 15 dependencies in RubyGems.org, and we released the alpha version of <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1729">two-factor authentication</a> for logging into the website. If you’d like to try it now, enable it by running <code>document.cookie='mfa_feature=true;path=/'</code> in your browser console. We’re working on adding support for multiple factors to the CLI as well, and you should see more updates on it next month.</p>

    <p>We also fixed a few small bugs around the dashboard and Atom feeds for users who are logged out.</p>

    <p>This month, RubyGems.org gained 38 commits from 4 authors, making 1,124 additions and 183 deletions across 84 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems saw better symlink handling, some improved warning messages, and better testing on windows. We also made the flags for the <code>pristine</code> and <code>cleanup</code> commands more consistent with the existing <code>install</code> command, and did some code cleanup. Finally, we imported some fixes from ruby-core to make sure RubyGems continues to work when OpenSSL is not available in Ruby.</p>

    <p>This month, RubyGems gained 70 new commits, contributed by 9 authors. There were 429 additions and 186 deletions across 41 files.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-toolbox-news">ruby toolbox news</h2>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>Last month I did some maintenance work by <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/214">upgrading to Rails 5.2</a> and addressing some common issues found when <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/246">syncing data from GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>In order to reduce errors stemming from fetching old projects multiple times, I added logic to ignore old GitHub references from gems for 14 days to allow us to unblock them if they reappear. Currently, this affects approximately 11,000 projects (note that renaming owners and moved ownership should redirect properly to the new location). In the future, it might make sense to indicate this in the UI for said projects somehow since these libraries seem to be unmaintained, but we’ll see!</p>

    <p>I also began work on the public database dumps I mentioned last month. They are not quite ready yet, but I expect to ship them in the next few weeks, allowing you to also look at the mentioned gone repo numbers yourself in more detail.</p>

    <p>Once the database dumps are complete, I want to do some further syncing efficiency maintenance and work on the search improvements I already mentioned in the last update.</p>

    <p>As always, your feedback is very welcome. If you have any suggestions or thoughts you’d like to share you can do so via <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues">GitHub issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>

    <p>Thank you also to everyone who contributed pull requests in July: koflerm, paneq, spape, and splashinn.</p>

    <p>Best,
    Christoph</p>

    <h2 id="budget-amp-expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>In July, we saw $15,375 in total income, and spent a total of $17,006.02.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$3,516.88 for 23.4 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>

  slug: october-and-november-2017-monthly-update
  layout_id: 2
  content_cache: "\n\n<p>Hello! Welcome to a super-sized double monthly update for
    the months of October and November. During that time, our work was supported by
    <a href=\"https://reinteractive.com/\">reinteractive</a>, <a href=\"http://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.bleacherreport.com\">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href=\"https://thoughtbot.com\">thoughtbot</a>,
    and many others.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-together-news\">ruby together news</h2>\n\n<p>In
    October and November, Ruby Together was supported by 76 different companies, including
    Ruby member <a href=\"https://reinteractive.com\">reinteractive</a> and Sapphire
    member <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>. On top of those companies, 4
    new developers signed. In total, we were supported by 96 individual members and
    68 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything
    that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>This semester, Ruby Together developer <a
    href=\"https://twitter.com/segiddins\">Samuel Giddins</a> finished his studies
    and graduated from college! \U0001F389 He’ll be moving from Chicago to San Francisco,
    and continuing to work on both Bundler and RubyGems. Go tweet some congratulations
    at him.</p>\n\n<p>At RubyConf 2017, André gave a completely new talk about the
    history of Bundler, called A History of Bundles: 2010 to 2017. You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXFYjO8qDxk\">watch
    the video from the conference</a>, <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/indirect/a-history-of-bundles-2010-to-2017\">check
    out the slide deck</a>, or <a href=\"http://andre.arko.net/2017/11/16/a-history-of-bundles/\">read
    the blog post version of the talk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, some board member news:
    founding board members Terence Lee and Sarah Mei have stepped down. We’re incredibly
    greatful to have had their help and support for almost three years. &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>As
    usual, the board will appoint successors to each vacant seat, to fill them until
    the next regularly scheduled board election. So far, the board has appointed one
    new director: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/valeriecodes\">Valerie Woolard Srinivasan</a>.
    We’re very happy to have her help, and looking forward to working with her.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"bundler-news\">bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>As far as Bundler goes, we were able
    to release the official <a href=\"http://bundler.io/blog/2017/10/31/bundler-1-16.html\">version
    1.16.0</a>, containing more than 20 bugfixes and some big improvements to the
    speed of the <code>install</code> command. It is now extremely fast to run <code>install</code>
    when nothing needs to be done. In addition, <a href=\"https://github.com/greysteil\">Gray
    Baker</a> of <a href=\"https://dependabot.com\">Dependabot</a> helped us ship
    some nice resolver improvements, pulling off the extremely rare victory of making
    the resolver more correct and faster at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Since the release
    of 1.16 at the end of October, we’ve fixed several new bugs that have cropped
    up, and we expect to release version 1.16.1 sometime this week. We also expect
    to ship 1.16.1 in the Ruby 2.5 rc1 release shortly.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Bundler
    gained 215 new commits, contributed by 30 authors. There were 2,249 additions
    and 1,151 deletions across 113 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org
    news</h2>\n\n<p>RubyGems.org saw a small amount of work, including some security,
    develpoment, and production fixes, as well as the usual ongoing security updates
    for the servers.</p>\n\n<p>Rubygems.org gained 7 new commits, contributed by 6
    authors. There were 29 additions and 0 deletions across 6 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems
    news</h2>\n\n<p>In October and November, we released RubyGems version 2.6.14,
    2.7.0, 2.7.1, 2.7.2, and 2.7.3. Those versions included some fixes backported
    from ruby-trunk, work to improve compatibility with Ruby 2.5, and upgrades for
    the version of Bundler included inside RubyGems, as well as a smattering of other
    bugfixes.</p>\n\n<p>On the topic of developing RubyGems, our very own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duckinator\">@duckinator</a>
    shipped <a href=\"https://github.com/duckinator/rgdev#readme\">rgdev</a>, a complete
    Docker-based environment for developing RubyGems. With setting up a development
    environment made easier, we will hopefully see more contributors over time. See
    Twitter for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duckinator/status/934089692601028608\">the
    tl;dr on how to use it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rubygems gained 114 new commits, contributed
    by 17 authors. There were 623 additions and 92 deletions across 35 files.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"gemstash-news\">gemstash news</h2>\n\n<p>Gemstash didn’t see any commits
    land during October or November. That said, if you’re interested in contributing
    to an open source project, the <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash/issues\">Gemstash
    issues list</a> has some promising-looking tickets. There’s definitely some openings
    for work on docs, the RubyGems.org mirror functionality, or the private gem hosting
    side of things.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-toolbox-news\">ruby toolbox news</h2>\n\n<p>Hey
    everyone,</p>\n\n<p>since the last update I got started putting the Toolbox back
    together - I built <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/catalog/pull/6\">tooling
    for exporting the flat-file based catalog to a JSON structure</a> that the <a
    href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/15\">backend app will be
    able to consume</a>. This will be wired to a webhook so merged catalog PRs will
    immediately show up on  the site.</p>\n\n<p>Further, I got the actual, <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/10\">new
    rails app started</a>, which involved getting CI running on Travis and <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/17\">setting
    up deployment and continuous delivery to Heroku</a>, who will be sponsoring hosting
    for the Toolbox - thanks a lot Heroku! I added <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/16\">basic
    category overview and detail UI</a>, also <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/20\">making
    it a bit prettier along the way</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The last missing piece needed to
    get the site back live is fetching the most basic stats and scoring for categorized
    projects from Rubygems and Github. I expect this to be done in early december.
    Until then, you can always see the current state of development at <a href=\"https://beta.ruby-toolbox.com\">beta.ruby-toolbox.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Once
    the site is back live with the bare minimum set of features, the next things to
    bring back will be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Getting all rubygems back to the site (not
    only the categorized ones)</li>\n  <li>Search</li>\n  <li>Adding more metrics
    to bring them on par with the old site</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please feel warmly invited
    to join <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox\">github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox</a>
    and see you next month!</p>\n\n<p>— <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thedeadserious\">Christoph</a></p>\n\n<h2

    work was supported by <a href=\"https://reinteractive.com/\">reinteractive</a>,
    <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bleacherreport.com\">Bleacher
    Report</a>, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com\">GitLab</a>, and many others.</p>\n\n<p>Since
    the last update, we shipped a security release of RubyGems, hired a new developer
    to work on security, funded the new Ruby Toolbox, and patched RubyGems.org to
    protect it from a newly-found variant of an old security hole.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-together-news\">ruby
    together news</h2>\n\n<p>In September, Ruby Together was supported by 138 different
    companies, including Ruby member <a href=\"https://reinteractive.com\">reinteractive</a>
    and Sapphire member <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>, and one new company.
    \ On top of those companies, 3 people signed up as members or friends of Ruby
    Together, including Stanislav (Stas) Katkov and Abu Nashir. In total, we were
    supported by 98 individual members and 70 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to
    all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>The
    other Ruby Together news is pretty exciting!</p>\n\n<p>To start with, we’ve brought
    on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/claudijd\">@claudijd</a> as a new developer,
    focused on security improvements for RubyGems. He’ll be helping respond to security
    researcher reports, fix security issues, and do all of the inevitable paperwork
    that results.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we’re extremely excited to announce that we are
    funding the upcoming, new, and improved <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox\">Ruby
    Toolbox</a>! We’ll be paying <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thedeadserious\">@thedeadserious</a>
    to rebuild the Ruby Toolbox back to its former glory, and beyond!</p>\n\n<p>If
    you’re interested, you can also <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues/1#issuecomment-333950079\">read
    the announcement from the Ruby Toolbox side</a>, or just keep reading to reach
    the very first Ruby Toolbox monthly update.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bundler-news\">bundler
    news</h2>\n\n<p>Bundler progress in September was steady. Along with @segiddins
    finishing off the last of his full-time summer hours, @arbonap continued to localize
    docs into Spanish, including automated tests for the Spanish documentation.</p>\n\n<p>We
    released the 1.16 prerelease, discovered some bugs, fixed them, and <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6031\">removed
    the message asking users to upgrade to prerelease versions</a>. We’re expecting
    a final 1.16 release sometime this month, since the latest prerelease is looking
    pretty stable.</p>\n\n<p>After that, we’ll be starting on the path to 2.0: updating
    documentation, writing blog posts, testing the upgrade path, and more. Most of
    all, we’ll be making sure that Bundler 1.x and 2.x can coexist peacefully, so
    that no one is forced to upgrade or downgrade because of the projects they work
    on.</p>\n\n<p>This month, Bundler gained 104 new commits, contributed by 14 authors.
    There were 1,220 additions and 417 deletions across 65 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org
    news</h2>\n\n<p>It was a quiet month for RubyGems.org… aside from the giant security
    issue, and the scramble to patch it, and then check every single existing gem
    to make sure it hadn’t been tampered with anytime in the last few years. The security
    issue was a big one, and potentially allowed any attacker to do anything they
    wanted to the RubyGems.org servers.</p>\n\n<p>After adding fixes just to the RubyGems.org
    server, the combined RubyGems and RubyGems.org teams ultimately decided to patch
    RubyGems itself to ensure that this kind of issue can’t happen on other computers
    that use RubyGems, or other servers. For more information, check out <a href=\"http://blog.rubygems.org/2017/10/09/unsafe-object-deserialization-vulnerability.html\">the
    RubyGems blog post about the security issue and its impact</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This
    month, Rubygems.org gained 4 new commits, contributed by 3 authors. There were
    12 additions and 10 deletions across 7 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems
    news</h2>\n\n<p>RubyGems itself saw only a little bit of activity this month.
    As a result of @hsbt’s heroic work, Bundler has been merged into the version of
    RubyGems that ships with Ruby itself! Now we’ll need to keep changes in sync between
    all three of ruby-core trunk, the RubyGems master branch, and the Bundler master
    branch. Oh boy. \U0001F62C</p>\n\n<p>On the bright side, you can already check
    out the fruits of all these teams’ labor in <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/10/10/ruby-2-5-0-preview1-released/\">Ruby

    be here :) I only just got started on bringing the Ruby Toolbox back the last
    week, but there’s already a place you can contribute to if you’d like: The categorization
    catalog is now on Github, and your help in cleaning it up, bringing it back up
    to date and expanding it is very welcome: <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/catalog\">github.com/rubytoolbox/catalog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In
    the next weeks I will be working on the core app itself, trying to bring it back
    online as quickly as possible and expanding from there. Over at GitHub, you can

    work was supported by <a href=\"http://reinteractive.com\">reinteractive</a>,
    <a href=\"http://stripe.com/\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\"http://gitlab.com/\">Gitlab</a>,
    <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\">Travis CI</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bleacherreport.com/\">Bleacher
    Report</a>, and many others.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-together-news\">ruby together
    news</h2>\n\n<p>In August, Ruby Together was supported by 83 different companies,
    including Sapphire member <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>. 2 companies
    joined as new members last month, including our first ever Ruby member, <a href=\"http://reinteractive.com\">reinteractive</a>!</p>\n\n<p>On
    top of those companies, 2 new developers joined as friends of Ruby Together. In
    total, we were supported by 105 individual members and 72 friends of Ruby Together.
    Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>In
    Ruby Together news, we successfully wrapped up a summer of full-time work from
    <a href=\"https://github.com/segiddins\">@segiddins</a>. His three months included
    a huge amount of extremely productive work, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>addressing
    several RubyGems security reports</li>\n  <li>a RubyGems security release</li>\n
    \ <li>code to allow RubyGems to (optionally) release with Bundler built in</li>\n
    \ <li>two Bundler 1.16 preview releases</li>\n  <li>addressing every outstanding
    blocker for <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%222.0+—+Breaking+Changes%22+is%3Aclosed\">the
    Bundler 2.0 github milestone</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On a slightly sadder note,
    founding board member <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steveklabnik\">Steve Klabnik</a>
    has stepped down from the board of directors. The remaining directors will appoint
    an interim director to serve out the rest of Steve’s term, and we will have a
    board election soon. We’re incredibly grateful to Steve for his support in getting
    Ruby Together off the ground, and we wish him the best as he focuses on Rust!
    ❤️</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the multiply-teased secret announcement is finally coming
    together, and we’ll be sharing details about it in the next update!</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"bundler-news\">bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>Building on the fantastic work done
    by Sam over the summer, RubyGems and ruby-core team member <a href=\"https://github.com/hsbt\">@hsbt</a>
    spent countless hours to get the Bundler test suite passing inside the overall
    Ruby language test suite. As a result of that work, <a href=\"https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12733#note-14\">Matz
    approved shipping Bundler with RubyGems, inside Ruby</a>. Bundler was merged into
    the Ruby standard library in <a href=\"https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/59779\">revision
    59780</a>, and is expected to ship with Ruby 2.5. Thank you for all your help
    and hard work, hsbt! \U0001F647</p>\n\n<p>Contributor <a href=\"https://github.com/arbonap\">@arbonap</a>
    began <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/pull/328\">translating
    the Bundler website into Spanish</a>, and has been enthusiastically assisted by
    several Spanish-speaking contributors. \U0001F49C</p>\n\n<p>The work on Bundler
    last month was focused on changes for 2.0—we have finished adding feature flags
    for every change, and the difference between Bundler 1.x and Bundler 2.0 will
    be the default values for those settings! Bundler core team member <a href=\"https://github.com/colby-swandale\">Colby
    Swandale</a> gave a talk at <a href=\"http://rubykaigi.org/2017\">RubyKaigi</a>
    about Bundler 2, and the Bundler team has kicked off the process of shipping the
    2.0 release.</p>\n\n<p>That means we’ll be spending at least a few weeks, and
    possibly a few months, testing workflows, updating documentation, writing blog
    posts, and working with users to ensure that the transition will be as smooth
    as possible. If you’re interested in trying it out and helping us improve the
    upgrade process, we would love to hear from you in <a href=\"https://slackin.bundler.io\">the
    Bundler Slack</a>!</p>\n\n<p>This month, Bundler gained 144 new commits, contributed
    by 15 authors. There were 2,395 additions and 730 deletions across 154 files.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org news</h2>\n\n<p>To help Bundler and RubyGems
    users connect to RubyGems.org in the future, <a href=\"https://github.com/indirect\">@indirect</a>
    and <a href=\"https://github.com/rubymorillo\">@rubymorillo</a> worked together
    to <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/pull/324\">expand the SSL
    troubleshooting guide</a>. We’d love to get your feedback on <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/blob/067698ae7b77a2769653315799f8741d74c73d52/source/v1.15/guides/rubygems_tls_ssl_troubleshooting_guide.html.md\">the
    work-in-progress guide</a>, so check it out!</p>\n\n<p>RubyGems.org saw ongoing
    maintenance, including gem upgrades, server upgrades, and other small improvements,
    as well as work on the database servers. In August, the RubyGems.org repo gained
    15 commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 52 additions and 57 deletions
    across 11 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems news</h2>\n\n<p>RubyGems
    saw ongoing maintenance and bugfixes, as well as patches for several security
    issues, included in the <a href=\"http://blog.rubygems.org/2017/08/27/2.6.13-released.html\">security
    release of version 2.6.13</a>. If you’re unable to upgrade to the latest RubyGems,
    check out <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/08/29/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-rubygems/\">the
    backport patches for Ruby 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4</a>. In total, Rubygems gained 57
    new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 978 additions and 302 deletions
    across 38 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gemstash-news\">gemstash news</h2>\n\n<p>On August
    21, Google Cloud Platform announced <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-gemserver\">google-cloud-gemserver</a>,
    a new gem from a summer intern to make running Gemstash on GCP as easy as running
    Gemstash on your local machine, which is super cool! You can read more about it
    <a href=\"https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/08/rolling-your-own-private-Ruby-gem-server-on-Google-Cloud-Platform.html\">in
    the announcement blog post</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, when the project was
    announced, I (André) jumped to conclusions and <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-gemserver/issues/36\">accused
    the project of violating Gemstash’s MIT license</a>. My post was unreasonably
    aggressive, and I shouldn’t have posted it, even if I had been right… which I
    wasn’t. I turned out to be completely wrong, and <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-gemserver/issues/36#issuecomment-324503159\">apologized
    to the author</a> a few hours later.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for letting you down, everyone.
    \U0001F494 I’ll try to be much more careful, and more gentle, in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Gemstash
    itself saw regular ongoing maintenance: the unyank command was removed, to mirror
    rubygems.org, and the tests were updated to run against the latest JRuby version.
    This month, Gemstash gained 19 new commits, contributed by 2 authors. There were
    22 additions and 381 deletions across 20 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"budget-amp-expenses\">budget

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During May and June, we paid for 179.4 hours of developer work on Bundler, RubyGems, and other open source tools. Our work was supported by <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://icelab.com.au/">Icelab</a>, <a href="http://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, <a href="http://cloudcity.io">Cloud City</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>In May and June, Ruby Together was supported by 81 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. 3 companies joined as new members, including <a href="https://dayoftheshirt.com">Day of the Shirt</a> and <a href="http://www.clickfunnels.com">ClickFunnels</a>.</p>

    <p>On top of those companies, 6 new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together, including Josh Cass, Mark Tareshawty, Anıl İyidoğan, Dian Pan, and Sangwon Yi. In total, we were supported by 113 individual members and 73 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <p>In company news, we’ve brought <a href="https://twitter.com/therubyrep">@therubyrep</a> onboard to help with admininstration work, including compiling these updates! We’re expecting to be more timely in the future as a result of her help.</p>

    <p>For project work, we have three announcements: The indomitable <a href="https://twitter.com/segiddins">@segiddins</a> has agreed to work on Bundler and RubyGems full time over the summer, and we’ve already seen that start to pay off in the form of countless Bundler PRs working towards Bundler 2.</p>

    <p>Next, <a href="https://twitter.com/radiomorillo">@radiomorillo</a> has joined us to help us craft a RubyGems.org SSL troubleshooting guide. Historically, we’ve seen many users report problems with SSL certificates, depending on their exact OS, OpenSSL installation, Ruby version, and other factors besides. In the future, we’re expecting many new issue reports when RubyGems.org deprecates versions of TLS older than 1.2. Hopefully, we’ll come up with a guide that can help everyone get their issues sorted out and get back to installing gems.</p>

    <p>Finally, we’ve also asked <a href="https://twitter.com/patricia_arbona">@parbona</a> to help us review and revise Bundler’s website and documentation with an eye towards helping and supporting new users and contributors. In the future, we’d love to get the documentation to a point where new developers can use the Bunlder docs to get started, rather than (usually) needing to be led through the process with explanations from more experienced developers.</p>

    <p>The secret announcement we teased last time isn’t quite ready yet, but we think you’ll be pleased once you hear it. Keep holding on, and we’ll get there!</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>In May and June, Bundler saw the release of 1.15 final, and the 1.15.1 bugfix release. The biggest changes in Bundler were: a huge speedup to <code>bundle exec</code> on large gemfiles, a new <code>bundle issue</code> command, a new <code>bundle add</code> command, and a new <code>bundle pristine</code> command. We also (finally) shipped man pages for every Bundler command that currently exists, and plan to maintain full manpage coverage for all future releases. If you’re interested in those changes, you can read more in <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2017/05/19/bundler-1-15-bundle-oh-so-fast.html">the Bundler 1.15 release announcement</a>, or just upgrade right away by running <code>gem install bundler</code>.</p>

    <p>Along with the 1.15 release, we kicked off a realistic plan towards releasing Bundler 2.0. Rather than forking into two codebases, we are implementing all of our planned changes for 2.0 as feature flags, disabled by default. Anyone interested can try out all of the changes that we’ve finished implementing so far by setting the relevant feature flags. Once everything is complete, we’ll be able to release a 2.0 with the new default settings, and it’s shaping up to be really great so far. It’s incredibly exciting to see (literally) years of planning pay off.</p>

    <p>In total, Bundler gained 248 new commits, contributed by 20 authors. There were 7,861 additions and 1,991 deletions across 920 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems.org saw a new <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1603">advanced search page</a>, updates to Rails and many other gems, and fixes to various and sundry bugs, including validations for email length, session expiration, and visual bugs on the 404 page.</p>

    <p>Overall, Rubygems.org gained 88 new commits, contributed by 9 authors. There were 1,375 additions and 764 deletions across 246 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>The RubyGems library also got some love, seeing new <code>signin</code> and <code>signout</code> commands for explicit authorization to RubyGems.org. There were also performance improvements and bugfixes from @segiddins. Rubygems gained 43 new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 365 additions and 112 deletions across 28 files.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash gained a new comprehensive health check, allowing automated systems to see whether a given Gemstash server is able to respond, reach the file storage, and reach the database. Ultimately, Gemstash gained 7 new commits, contributed by 1 author. There were 181 additions and 1 deletion across 12 files.</p>

    <h2 id="budget-amp-expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>In May, we saw $21,080.00 in total income, and spent a total of $19,089.33.</p>

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During April, our work was supported by <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, <a href="http://www.codeminer42.com">CodeMiner42</a>, <a href="http://cloudcity.io">Cloud City</a>, <a href="http://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>Last month, Ruby Together was supported by 79 different companies, including Sapphire members <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> and <a href="http://www.codeminer42.com">CodeMiner42</a>. Two companies joined as new members, including <a href="https://atomicobject.com">Atomic Object</a> and <a href="https://honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a>.</p>

    <p>On top of those companies, three developers signed up to be friends of Ruby Together, and two new developers joined as members, Dominic Dagradi and Ambreen Hasan. In total, we were supported by 115 individual members and 76 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <p>April saw us continue to move forward with plans for funding additional Ruby projects. We can’t announce it just yet, but <a href="https://twitter.com/rubytogether">follow us on twitter</a> or read next month’s newsletter for what will hopefully be an exciting announcement.</p>

    <p>Some other plans moved forward as well, and we launched our <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/feedback">public feedback forum</a>. Since the beginning, Ruby and RubyGems have been maintained and advanced by a small group of passionate volunteers. We have all of them to thank for the large, vibrant community that exists today. However, Ruby has matured to the point where its supporting infrastructure is both vital to the larger internet economy, and can no longer be maintained by a few volunteers.</p>

    <p>We created Ruby Together to allow Ruby devs and companies to collectively pay developers for their time and effort working on central and critical projects. That said, our primary goal is to to serve and improve the entire Ruby community.</p>

    <p>To help us do that more effectively, we’re creating this repo as a collaborative forum where anyone who is passionate about Ruby open source and infrastructure can share and discuss their ideas, opinions, and concerns with each other and with the Ruby Together team. Membership is Ruby Together is not required to participate or give feedback, and all feedback will be read and considered as we decide how to best support the Ruby community in the future. Come by and <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/feedback/issues">tell us how you think we’re doing</a>!</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>Last month, we started pushing prereleases of Bundler 1.15. As of today, we’re up to version 1.15.0.pre.4, and it’s looking increasingly likely that the next version will be the release candidate. Highlight features for 1.15 include man pages for all commands (thanks, @feministy!), a <code>bundle issue</code> command to help users report problems (thanks, @jonathanpike!), and a <code>bundle add</code> command (thanks, @denniss!).</p>

    <p>On top of those changes, version 1.15 will also include dramatically improved performance when loading Bundler in applications with hundreds of gems, and the huge improvement to error messages when a matching version can’t be found that we mentioned in <a href="https://rubytogether.org/news/2017-04-18-march-2017-monthly-update">our last monthly update</a>.</p>

    <p>Many other bugs were fixed, and additional smaller features have been added. Check out <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">the Bundler changelog</a> for the full details. In total, this month 13 authors pushed 149 commits, including 1,668 additions and 306 deletions across 78 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>The biggest event for RubyGems.org this month was <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/phase-two-our-tls-10-and-11-deprecation-plan/">Fastly’s planned deprecation of TLS 1.0 and 1.1</a>. We didn’t realize it beforehand, but many, many developers and servers are still using Ruby without support for TLS 1.2. We were surprised because support for TLS 1.2 was added to OpenSSL <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Major_version_releases">in version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012</a>, over five years ago! In a group effort, we were able to work together with <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a> and <a href="https://www.fastly.com">Fastly</a> to quickly add back support for the older TLS 1.0 and 1.1.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the PCI Security Standards Council’s requirements mean that Fastly will be disabling TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for all users, including RubyGems.org, at the end of April 2018. This month, we started working on an early warning system that will inform Ruby developers if they need to upgrade, and we will roll it out later this year to make sure that everyone has plenty of time to adjust before the older versions of TLS are disabled again.</p>

    <p>In total, RubyGems.org gained 21 new commits, with 4 different contributors changing 63 files. There were 851 additions and 305 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>For RubyGems, April saw the release of version 2.6.12. Fixes include installing gems on MinGW systems, the <code>gem open</code> command once again opening the newest version of a gem by default, and generating binstubs (like the file named <code>rake</code>, used to run rake commands) that will work with both current and older versions of RubyGems. In total, RubyGems saw 17 new commits from 6 different contributors. They changed 16 files, with 162 additions and 61 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash didn’t see any major changes during April, but it’s still a solid option if you need to host your own private gems or set up a local cache for RubyGems.org on your machine, in your office, or in your datacenter. In total, Gemstash gained 3 new commits. 2 different authors changed 5 files, with 37 additions and 6 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>In April, we saw $22,252 in total income, and spent a total of $9,479.49.</p>

    <ul>

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During March, our work was supported by <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, <a href="http://www.codeminer42.com/">CodeMiner42</a>, <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://icelab.com.au/">Icelab</a>, <a href="http://www.bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>On the whole, this month was pretty quiet. We filed our taxes, worked on some plans for the future, and continued to pay for developer hours to maintain Ruby’s tooling infrastructure.</p>

    <p>In March, Ruby Together was supported by 88 different companies, including <a href="#">Stripe</a> and <a href="#">CodeMiner42</a>. Four companies joined as new members, including <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu">Brandeis University</a>, <a href="http://www.scoutrfp.com/">Scout RFP</a>, and <a href="http://www.modernmsg.com/">Modern Message</a>.</p>

    <p>On top of those companies, three developers signed up as friends of Ruby Together, including Byron Appelt. In total, we were supported by 183 individual members and 91 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>During March, we fixed bugs and started merging new features for Bundler 1.15. The most exciting change is a much clearer explanation when a Gemfile cannot be resolved.</p>

    <p>Previously, any requirement for a failed gem would be printed out. That meant the error message would include things like “Could not resolve requirement <code>rack ~&gt; 10.1</code>, Gemfile contained <code>rack 10.2</code>”. Since Rack version 10.2 is allowed by that requirement, it was not helpful to include it in the error message. Error messages when resolution fails in the future will be much easier to understand, since they will only include the requirements that could not be met.</p>

    <p>A host of additional small features and fixes were added as well. Check out <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">the Bundler changelog</a> to read about all of them. In total, Bundler gained 78 new commits. 16 different contributors changed 51 files, with 638 additions and 151 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems.org saw updates to better validate incoming data, improve performance, and add a content security policy. We also merged support for self-service account deletion and about a dozen gem updates. In total, RubyGems.org gained 21 new commits. 4 different contributors changed 63 files, with 851 additions and 305 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>Version 2.6.11 of RubyGems was released, with improvements to resolving gem dependencies, a fix for gems compiled on MinGW, and a couple of bugfixes backported from Ruby trunk. In total, RubyGems gained 17 new commits. 6 different contributors changed 16 files, with 162 additions and 61 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash gained the new feature of logging directly to stdout, making it easier to integrate with services like Heroku that expect logs to be printed. In total, Gemstash gained 3 new commits. 2 different authors changed 5 files, with 37 additions and 6 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>In March, we saw $23,033 in total income, and spent a total of $16,881.76.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$4,256 for 28.4 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$1,919 for 12.8 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$2,063 for 13.8 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$1,125 for 7.5 hours worked on other OSS and devtools at $150/hour</li>

  title: January and February 2017 Monthly Update
  slug: january-and-february-2017-monthly-update
  layout_id: 2
  content_cache: |2+


    <p>Hello, everyone! Welcome to the monthly update—or in this particular case, two monthly updates. During the months of January and February, our work was supported by <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, <a href="http://www.codeminer42.com/">CodeMiner42</a>, <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com/" title="DigitalOcean">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" title="Travis CI">Travis CI</a>, <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/" title="thoughtbot">thoughtbot</a>, and many, many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>In some ways, January and February were boring and run-of-the-mill: we paid developers to work on open source, and Ruby OSS infrastructure was maintained and improved. We were supported by 84 companies, including <a href="http://travis-ci.com">Travis</a>, <a href="http://www.airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>, and <a href="http://gitlab.com">GitLab</a> all renewing their memberships for the entire year of 2017. 13 companies joined as new members, including <a href="https://evilmartians.com">Evil Martians</a>, <a href="https://makandra.com">makandra</a>, <a href="http://substancelab.com">Substance Lab</a>, <a href="https://instrumentalapp.com">Instrumental</a>, <a href="https://buildkite.com">Buildkite</a>, <a href="https://docraptor.com">DocRaptor</a>, <a href="http://www.evolvingmedia.net/">Evolving Media Network / Moonfarmer</a>, <a href="https://newington.nsw.edu.au">Newington College</a>, <a href="http://www.makemusic.com/">MAKEMUSIC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/benlovellltd">Ben Lovell Ltd</a>.</p>

    <p>On top of those companies, 42 developers signed up as friends of Ruby Together, and 18 developers signed up as members, including Jon Atack, Eric Henderson, Nichol Alexander, Bess Sadler, Daniel Fone, Spencer Roach, Jeff Sandberg, Ivan Stana, Piotr Szmielew, Daniel Leavitt, Andrei Beliankou, Matthew Werner, Eliot Sykes, and Richard Harrah. In total, we were supported by over 180 individual members and 88 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <p>In some other ways, though, these months were surprisingly eventful: the Ruby Together board was approached in private by a group of concerned developers. The feedback those developers gave broke down into three categories. First, the Bundler post-install message was unfortunately misleading some people into thinking that Ruby Together pays for the RubyGems.org servers, when that is not the case. Second, they were concerned that Ruby Together could be seen as a way for André and the other funded maintainers to blackmail companies into paying Ruby Together for features or bugfixes. Finally, the group said they also felt upset there was no official avenue to accept their feedback to Ruby Together.</p>

    <p>The Ruby Together board listened to their feedback, and will be addressing all three points. To start with, the Bundler team has removed the Bundler post-install message until they can come up with a clearer one. The Bundler readme has also been revised to clarify what Ruby Together pays for, and make it clear that feature requests will always be evaluated on their own merits, not based on whether the person or company proposing the feature is a member.</p>

    <p>Towards addressing the second point, we have started work on an official project funding policy. The policy will make our criteria for funding projects public, as well as detailing the mechanisms we employ to separate recipients of funds from decisions about funding them. Keep an eye out for that policy in a separate announcement in the coming weeks.</p>

    <p>Finally, in order to help Ruby Together accomplish its goal of serving the entire community, we will be establishing a public feedback group just for Ruby Together. We will use that forum to open discussion of policy and funding issues, and especially to get feedback on proposed plans before they are implemented. Participation will be open to anyone who uses Ruby, not just members. Our work is for the whole community, and we want to hear from all of them.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>The exciting news for Bundler in this update is a feature release: 1.14. Version 1.14 validates downloaded .gem files against checksums provided by RubyGems.org, it improves support for running a single bundled application on more than one OS, and shows dramatically more information if the Ruby or RubyGems version conflicts with gem requirements.</p>

    <p>After releasing 1.14 final, we continued to fix reported bugs, including a small number of regressions. Between Dec 29 and Feb 22, we pushed 5 bugfix releaseso fixing many reported issues and repairing compatibility with the upcoming Ruby 2.5 release. In total, Bundler merged 106 pull requests that included 152 commits. 24 different contributors changed 266 files, with 3,135 additions and 1,066 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>Over on RubyGems.org, changing your email address got more reliable: we now require verification of your new email address before removing your old one. Along with the usual security updates, we also dramatically improved the performance of the inverse dependencies API. In total, RubyGems.org merged 3 pull requests including 89 commits. 12 different contributors changed 95 files, with 2,477 additions and 1,838 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>There were two bugfix releases of RubyGems, version 2.6.9 and 2.6.10, fixing six miscellaneous bugs and updating the dependency resolver shared with Bundler and CocoaPods. In total, RubyGems merged 33 pull requests that included 33 commits, and 9 contributors changed 40 files, with 569 additions and 158 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash released version 1.0.4, adding private gem support for the <code>latest_gems</code> endpoint used by <code>gem install</code>. In total, Gemstash merged 2 pull requests that included 26 commits. 5 contributors changed 19 files, with 387 additions and 87 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>In the months of January and February combined, we saw $45,031 in total income, and spent a total of $44,893.72.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$9,994 for 66.6 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$10,134 for 67.6 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$2,505 for 16.7 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$2,543 for 17.0 hours worked on other OSS and devtools at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$142.09 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$1465.08 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$5337.41 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>
      <li>$8025.0 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$4749.14 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>
    </ul>

  content_cache: "\n\n<p>Happy new year, everyone, and welcome to the (only <em>slightly</em>
    delayed by the holidays \U0001F602) Ruby Together monthly update for December!
    During the month of December, our work was supported by <a href=\"http://stripe.com/\">Stripe</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.codeminer42.com/\">CodeMiner42</a>, <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a>,
    <a href=\"http://airbnb.com\">Airbnb</a>, <a href=\"http://gitlab.com\">Gitlab</a>,
    and many, many others.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-together-news\">ruby together news</h2>\n\n<p>To
    start things off, December was our biggest month ever since Ruby Together began.
    We were supported by over 100 individual developers, 60 small companies, and a
    dozen large companies like <a href=\"http://stripe.com/\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.codeminer42.com/\">CodeMiner42</a>,
    <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a>, <a href=\"http://airbnb.com\">Airbnb</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://gitlab.com\">Gitlab</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This month was also a
    great month for new members. Six new developers signed up to support our work
    as Friends of Ruby Together. On top of that, ten more developers joined as members,
    including Nishant Modak, Thom May, Jack Bracewell, George Millo, Karlotcha Hoa,
    Stanislav Katkov, Chris Holmes. In addition, five completely new companies added
    their support: <a href=\"https://www.chef.io/\">Chef</a>, <a href=\"http://www.unboxed.co/\">Unboxed</a>,
    <a href=\"http://carbonfive.com/\">Carbon Five</a>, <a href=\"https://teezily.com/\">Teezily</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://www.intellum.com/\">Intellum</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to all
    of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>In exciting
    news for the upcoming year, our team gained an Empress of Documentation: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/feministy\">Liz
    Abinante</a>. We’re super excited to have a mastermind behind making Bundler and
    RubyGems more understandable and accessible for new users.</p>\n\n<p>On the board
    of directors, we saw <a href=\"http://twitter.com/randommood\">Ines Sombra</a>
    step down from her position. Ines has been a fantastic and incredibly helpful
    board member, and we’re super grateful to have had her input. Thanks for everything,
    Ines. &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>The remaining members of the board nominated <a href=\"https://twitter.com/camille_\">Camille
    Baldock</a> to fill the newly empty seat, and she graciously accepted. Camille
    participated in this year’s board election, coming in just one or two votes behind
    the other candidates. We’re incredibly glad to have another chance to work with
    Camille, and are looking forward to getting even more done in 2017.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"bundler-news\">bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>December was a good month for Bundler.
    We released one bugfix release, <code>1.13.7</code>, and we released a preview
    of the next version of Bundler, version <code>1.14.0.pre.1</code>. 13 contributors
    created 99 commits, and changed 63 files with 783 additions and 193 deletions.</p>\n\n<p>Bundler
    1.14 includes a huge number of bugfixes and small additional features, mostly
    focused on improving how well existing commands work. Support for different operating
    systems and platforms is improved, Ruby 2.5 (compiled from source control) is
    supported, and a notable error caused by an invalid lock file is now handled automatically.
    For a full list of improvements, <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1140pre1-2016-12-29\">check
    out the changelog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org news</h2>\n\n<p>The
    RubyGems.org service was given the usual security updates this month, and saw
    a couple of useful fixes. Changing email addresses now requires confirmation before
    activation, so users can’t lock themselves out with a typo. 9 contributors created
    47 commits, changing 59 files with 565 additions and 202 deletions.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems news</h2>\n\n<p>RubyGems continued to gain ground
    on the backlog of bugs and issues. The most notable changes were speed improvements
    for <code>require 'rubygems'</code>, and a fix for hash collisions when comparing
    objects. 4 contributors created 16 commits, changing 11 files with 88 additions
    and 48 deletions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gemstash-news\">gemstash news</h2>\n\n<p>Gemstash
    wasn’t super busy, but still gained some features: it is now possible to set arbitrary
    Sequel connection options, and the connection pool now defaults to the same size
    as the number of running Puma threads. In total, 2 contributors made 8 commits,
    changing 7 files with 41 additions and 6 deletions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"budget--expenses\">budget
    &amp; expenses</h2>\n\n<p>From November 20 to December 19, Ruby Together took
    in $22,620. In total, we spent $23,552.35. Here’s a breakdown of where the money
    went:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>$3,600 for 24 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\n
    \ <li>$3,000 for 20 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\n  <li>$2,850

    while stickers and pins ship immediately!</p>\n\n<p>We had three improvements
    with our meta tooling this month. The <a href=\"https://github.com/how-is/how_is\">how_is</a>
    tool got another <a href=\"https://github.com/how-is/how_is/blob/v11.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#1100\">release</a>,
    and will soon be used to actively <a href=\"https://how-is.github.io/how-is-rubygems/2016/12/01/report.html\">appraise
    the status</a> of our various projects.</p>\n\n<p>We also created a <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytogether/rubytogether-lita/blob/84f6bec5d2faabbcb914132cd2880b8e7bacf33e/lib/lita/handlers/time_card.rb\">time-card</a>
    handler for the <a href=\"https://www.lita.io/\">lita</a> bot, soon to be available
    for use in a chat room near you!</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we shipped a new merge-bot:
    <a href=\"https://github.com/bundlerbot\">@bundlerbot</a>. We’ve been using the
    <a href=\"http://homu.io\">homu.io</a> service for over a year, but a long-standing
    bug prevented us from managing team member permissions. Now we have <a href=\"https://bundlerbot-homu.herokuapp.com\">our
    own copy of homu</a>, and we look forward to updating team members and merging
    only green code for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>Last in Ruby Together news, this
    month we partnered with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrb_bk\">@mrb_bk</a>’s <a
    href=\"http://computermodern.io\">Computer Modern</a>. We need more companies
    to join as members for Ruby Together to be sustainable in the long run, so it’s
    exciting to have expert help. We’ll be working with Computer Modern in the coming
    weeks and months to create resources for Ruby developers and Ruby Together members.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"bundler-news\">bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>This month bundler and <a href=\"https://bundler.io\">bundler.io</a>
    got an array of documentation fixes / updates, due in large part to our new contributor
    <a href=\"https://github.com/colby-swandale\">@colby-swandale</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Bundler
    got a <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/rfcs\">Request For Comments</a> repo,
    inspired by the one utilized by <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/\">Rust</a>.

    listing all outdated gems</a>. And we also <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/5213\">fixed
    an <code>ObjectBoundsExceededError</code></a> on <a href=\"https://rubinius.com/\">Rubinius</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As
    mentioned last month, Bundler 1.13 shipped with <a href=\"http://bundler.io/blog/2016/09/08/bundler-1-13.html\"><code>required_ruby_version</code>
    support</a> for Gemfiles containing a <code>ruby</code> declaration. Building
    on that, we hoped to release 1.14 with automatic support for the currently running
    Ruby version.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last two months or so, the Bundler team has been
    discussing and experimenting with different ways to handle Gemfiles without an
    explicit <code>ruby</code>. The heroic @segiddins <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/5013\">attempted
    to implement</a> our rough consensus for the feature, but we ran into a plethora
    of edge cases and problems with backwards compatibility. In the end, we went back
    to the drawing board and designed a new way to handle it that should be much better.</p>\n\n<p>Downside:
    this work delayed Bundler 1.14, and now we’re going to ship 1.14 without automatic
    Ruby locking. Upside: it will be a much better feature when it’s done. Hooray.</p>\n\n<p>In
    total, 11 authors pushed 59 commits to Bundler last month. 61 files changed and
    there were 1,990 additions and 1,629 deletions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org

    the database calls required for search requests. And <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1432\">added</a>

    <p>Welcome to the October 2016 Ruby Together monthly update! This month we released Bundler <code>1.13.[3..6]</code>, weathered great internet storms, and dramatically improved response times. We did it with 70.3 hours of paid work on Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>This month, Michael R. Bernstein (@mrb_bk) has joined us as a consultant to help with marketing, sales, and automation. (You can see more about what he does with his company Computer Modern at <a href="http://computermodern.io">computermodern.io</a>!)</p>

    <p>There were 6 new developer members this month! Many thanks to Megan Tiu, John Akers, Rob Nichols, Olivier Lacan, Cameron Dutro, and Christoph Lupprich ^_^ !!!</p>

    <p>We also saw signups from two new corporate members this month: <a href="https://gleam.io/">Gleam</a>, a business growth and marketing platform, and <a href="https://brakemanpro.com/">Brakeman Pro</a>, a Rails security auditing system.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>We released Bundler <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1133-2016-10-10">1.13.3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1134-2016-10-11">1.13.4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1135-2016-10-15">1.13.5</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1136-2016-10-22">1.13.6</a>. <code>1.13.3</code> was support for rubygems.org infrastructure changes, <code>1.13.[4..6]</code> was your regularly scheduled fixes and optimizations.</p>

    <p>We noticed from our traffic stats that a few thousand <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about">Bash on Windows</a> users were experiencing <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4599">bundler/bundler#4599</a>. <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/352">The cause</a> of this issue is home directory permissions, but we pushed out a fix for the sake of the number of effected users. <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/5043">This fix</a> was deployed in <code>1.13.4</code>.</p>

    <p>In total, Bundler had 35 merged pull requests and 106 commits from 12 authors, and closed 59 issues.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>We finished moving Bundler server infrastructure into rubygems.org, culminating in resolving an issue with <code>/versions</code> mismatches. With this, we are now serving all of rubygems.org from <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a>. This change <a href="https://twitter.com/dwradcliffe/status/786280193107202048">cut down server response times by half</a>!</p>

    <p>Later in the month, we survived the survived the <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/blame-the-internet-of-things-for-destroying-the-internet-today">Great DNS Outage of 2016</a>. <a href="https://rubygems.org/">rubygems.org</a> was up the entire time, although most of our other tools weren’t.</p>

    <p>In total, RubyGems.org had 18 merged pull requests and 33 commits from 8 authors.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>We released RubyGems <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/9fb8880976f5ab998912898b091d88aa10eb1d4a">2.6.8</a> this month. This release comes with <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1751">improved SSL error messaging</a>, which will hopefully relieve some frustration during this time of great turmoil.</p>

    <p>In total, RubyGems had 18 merged pull requests and 29 commits from 10 authors.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>From September 19 to October 18, Ruby Together took in $22,851.42. In total, we spent $20,368.58. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$3,960 for 26.4 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,390 for 22.6 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,188 for 21.3 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>

      <li>$974.08 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="future-plans">future plans</h2>

    <p>In the coming months we plan on releasing Bundler 1.14 with better permissions error handling. We also are going to do several rounds of updates on the documentation for <a href="https://bundler.io">bundler.io</a> and <a href="https://rubygems.org">rubygems.org</a></p>

    <p>Welcome to the September 2016 Ruby Together monthly update! This month we added a variety of new features in Bundler 1.13, as well as bug fixes in 1.13.1 and 1.13.2. We paid for 71.3 hours of work on Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org. Also, André gave a great talk at EuRuKo 2016 leading to 18 (!) new members.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>André gave a talk at <a href="http://euruko2016.org/">EuRuKo</a> about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/indirect/a-year-of-ruby-together">the first year of of working on Ruby Together</a>. The video isn’t posted yet, but you can read <a href="https://rubytogether.org/news/2016-09-27-a-year-of-ruby-together">our blog post based on the talk</a>.</p>

    <p>The first year of Ruby Together has been amazing! We’ve done more than we ever expected, and the community has come together in the best way possible to improve things for everyone. We’re not safe yet, though! The rapidly increasing demands of Ruby developers and companies are pushing us to the limit as we keep everything working.</p>

    <p>This is the time for companies with profitable businesses to step up and pay it forward to the next group of devs and companies that will benefit from open, free tools. Without more support, it’s just a matter of time until we can’t keep up. You can do it, Ruby community! We believe in you. &lt;3</p>

    <p>Thanks so much to our many new developer members !!! Tiago Mendes-Costa, Colby M. White, Vincent Daubry, Pascal Betz, Marion Schleifer, Adam Niedzielski, Tony Drake, Cecile Veneziani, Fernando Seror, and Keycoopt !!!</p>

    <p>Another thanks to our corporate members, the valiant organizations committed to securing their income by funding their infrastructure. New corporate members this month are: <a href="http://www.hexagonconsulting.co/">Hexagonal Consulting</a>, <a href="https://www.kiskolabs.com/">Kisko Labs</a>, and <a href="http://hired.com/?utm_source=sponsor&amp;utm_medium=rubytogether&amp;utm_campaign=q4-16-rubytogether">Hired</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://hired.com/?utm_source=sponsor&amp;utm_medium=rubytogether&amp;utm_campaign=q4-16-rubytogether">Hired</a> in particular signed up as a Sapphire member, putting it up with just Stripe and CodeMiner42 in supporting our work on Ruby infrastructure. Hired is an organization for empowering developers to find job opportunities with groundbreaking companies—from household names to emerging startups, and everything in between. Developers with Hired get access to over 4,400 innovative companies, and can quickly evaluate multiple offers side-by-side to choose the right fit with confidence.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>Early in the month, we released <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2016/09/08/bundler-1-13.html">Bundler 1.13</a>. This update features <code>required_ruby_version</code>, <code>bundle doctor</code>, and platform <code>lock</code> commands. Later in the month, <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/milestone/32?closed=1">Bundler 1.13.1</a> shipped with a variety of minor bug fixes.</p>

    <p>Chris Morris (<a href="https://github.com/chrismo">@chrismo</a>) was added to Bundler’s <a href="http://bundler.io/contributors.html">contributor team</a>. His core team promotion was sponsored by the experimental <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/#experimental-conservative-updates">conservative update</a> that shipped with 1.13.</p>

    <p>We fixed a <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4992">GEM_PATH regression</a> in release 1.13. This bug was truly an adventure, and threw our core team for a loop for most of two weeks. Finally, we started working towards the Better Platform Support update with <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4984">the help</a> of <a href="https://github.com/headius">@headius</a> and <a href="http://jruby.org/">jruby</a>.</p>

    <p>In total, Bundler had 37 merged pull requests and 83 commits from 11 authors, and closed 50 issues.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>We experienced the <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/1429">life and death</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/rubygems">@rubygems</a> this month. Many thanks to our valiant users, always on hand to pull our Twitter accounts back from the abyss.</p>

    <p>We also worked on both server side (<a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1414">rate limiting</a>), and end user focused (<a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1396">gem yank</a>) security issues.</p>

    <p>In total, RubyGems.org had 13 merged pull requests and 26 commits from 5 authors.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>We released RubyGems 2.6.7 which features bug fixes for <code>--user-install</code>, and <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/compare/v2.6.6...v2.6.7">other miscellaneous fixs</a>.</p>

    <p>We also worked on more <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1681">organization and infrastructure</a> for the upcoming 3.0 merger, in addition to an array of <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=merged%3A2016-09-01..2016-09-27%20rubygems%20">small integration changes</a>.</p>

    <p>In total, RubyGems had 8 merged pull requests and 21 commits from 6 authors.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>From August 19 to September 18, Ruby Together took in $19,237. In total, we spent $13,543.78. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$3690 for 24.6 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3923 for 26.2 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3075 for 20.5 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>

    <p><a href="https://rubytogether.org">Ruby Together</a> has been around for over a year! It’s actually been about 18 months, but that didn’t sound as snappy. To celebrate, I’ve put together this summary of our history: why and how we exist, what we’ve done, and what the future holds.</p>

    <p>So, what even <em>is</em> Ruby Together? Ruby Together is a non-profit that pays developers to work on RubyGems, Bundler, and more, using funds from members. Members can be any person or company who uses Ruby, and the work we pay for is free for anyone to use.</p>

    <p>But what, exactly, does that mean? And why do we need a non-profit to do this in the first place? The explanation lies the current state of the Ruby community.</p>

    <h2 id="there-are-some-problems">there are some problems</h2>
    <p>Put simply, the problem is that Ruby has grown up. The Ruby community has become so large that our existing community infrastructure isn’t sustainable anymore.</p>

    <h3 id="the-gems-theyre-multiplying">the gems! they’re multiplying!</h3>
    <p>As you’ve probably noticed, Bundler makes it easier to use gems and makes it easier to create gems. Over the 6 years that I’ve spent working on Bundler, the number of gems in existence has multiplied, and the number of gem downloads has multiplied. There are now over 100,000 gems, and those gems have over a million versions.</p>

    <p>With those million versions comes a completely unprecedented number of downloads. In the years from 2003 to the end of 2014, we tracked roughly 2 billion gem downloads. That’s 2 billion downloads over more than ten years. Then, in 2015 alone (just one year!) we served 4 billion gem downloads.</p>

    <p>That is an <em>extremely</em> steep increase. If we were a startup, we’d have great graphs to show VCs and convince them to give us money. But we’re not a startup. Before Ruby Together, all of RubyGems.org was maintained for free by volunteers. That’s a problem, because at the same time that usage has been increasing exponentially, volunteer help hasn’t been increasing.</p>

    <h3 id="the-volunteer-crisis">the volunteer crisis</h3>
    <p>Most people don’t realize this, but the RubyGems.org team is incredibly small. It’s never had more than four people on it, and most often has only had two. The Bundler team is even smaller—it’s never had more than two people working on it consistently, and often only one.</p>

    <p>None of those team members were ever paid for their work. To pay their bills, every single one of them has to have a full-time job doing something else. A few volunteers giving up their nights and weekends to help the community used to be enough, but it’s not anymore.</p>

    <p>Using open source ethically means supporting the tools and infrastructure you use, with money or  time. Instead of supporting our community infrastructure, companies are taking community resources and then not giving back. These companies are making millions (and sometimes billions) of dollars. They could easily afford to support us, but choose not to. Let me give an example that really highlights this point.</p>

    <h3 id="remember-when-rubygemsorg-got-hacked">remember when rubygems.org got hacked?</h3>
    <p>About 3 years ago, RubyGems.org went down completely, for over a week.  There was a security issue, and although the team knew about the security issue and planned to fix it, everyone on the team had a day job. The best we could do was plan to fix the problem that weekend. Unfortunately, a motivated hacker figured out how to break to during the week.</p>

    <p>We had to take the servers down and create completely new servers from scratch. We also had to download and verify every single one of the hundreds of thousands of .gem files, to make sure the hacker hadn’t replaced any of them while he had access.</p>

    <p>During this time, hundreds of Ruby developers volunteered to help. This isn’t super surprising, since almost every Ruby developer and company depends on RubyGems.org in order to be able to do their work. What is terrible is that none of those volunteers could do anything useful. None of them were already familiar with how the servers worked, and helping them get up to speed would have slowed down the recovery efforts.</p>

    <p>The worst part, though, is that once RubyGems.org was back up… all of those volunteers disappeared. None of them were wiling to get up to speed and help out when there wasn’t an emergency. Even though the RubyGems infrastructure is vitally important to all of these companies, they can’t or won’t allow their employees to help make sure it keeps working.</p>

    <h3 id="the-non-solution-of-open-source-jobs">the non-solution of open source jobs</h3>
    <p>At this point, you might say “Aha! But companies sometimes hire Ruby developers specifically to work on open source. Let’s just keep doing that.” While that is a great thing, and I am very glad that companies sometimes choose to do that, it is not a solution to the crisis we are facing.</p>

    <p>Very few companies have ever hired Ruby developers to work on open source full time. Even including all of the last 10 years, I can only think of Engine Yard, Sun, AT&amp;T, RedHat, Heroku, Shopify, GitHub. I’m sure there are others, but there can’t be that many.</p>

    <p>Even if there were more companies doing this, though, it would still be a problem. Engine Yard is the perfect example of a very helpful company turning out to be extremely disruptive to the community. At one point in time, Engine Yard (by itself!) employed not just the Rubinius and JRuby teams, but also everyone working full-time on Rails.</p>

    <p>Eventually, though, they decided to stop. After Engine Yard wound down their open source positions, the JRuby team had moved to another company, but the Rubinius team and Rails team no longer had any full-time developers. If a single executive at SalesForce changes their mind, most of the full-time developers on Ruby core will be out of a job. We can do better than a community dependent on one or two companies.</p>

    <p>Ruby Together spreads the costs across many companies and people. Everyone shares the costs of paying developers, and everyone shares the benefits. Even better, that sharing means we’re not dependent on any single company to be able to do our work. A single company changing their mind or cutting costs is no longer enough to disrupt the community.</p>

    <h2 id="how-it-came-about">how it came about</h2>
    <p>Working on Bundler and RubyGems over the last six years had made these problems clear to me, but most of the people I talked to didn’t think they were important problems. Bundler and RubyGems had always gotten along with work from volunteers! Companies were able to build huge and wildly profitable companies on top of Ruby open source, so everything seemed fine.</p>

    <p>I spent years experimenting with different ideas for how Bundler and RubyGems could make enough money to support paying developers. I tested out support contracts, feature bounties, enterprise-only features, and more. None of them were enough of an improvement for companies to want to pay for them. Even worse, every option was a huge time-sink away from the actual goal of working on the open source projects.</p>

    <p>One company was willing to support Bundler directly, without any conditions or requirements: <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. Using funds from Stripe, I was able to do research, hire a lawyer, and found Ruby Together.</p>

    <p>Ruby Together incorporated as a particular kind of non-profit company—what the U.S. government calls a “trade association”. Other trade associations you may have heard of include the Linux Foundation, the Jquery Foundation, and the Sqlite Foundation, but the best-known example is the American Dairy Farmers’ Association.</p>

    <p>The American Dairy Farmers’ Association pays for the “Got Milk?” ad campaigns. Those ad campaigns cost more than a single dairy farmer could afford, but they benefit all dairy farmers by promoting milk. Each trade association uses membership dues to fund community projects that benefit all members of that trade, whether they belong to the association or not.</p>

    <h2 id="what-weve-done">what we’ve done</h2>
    <p>Speaking of benefiting everyone, let’s talk about some of the things that Ruby Together has done in it’s first year and a half. The big, underlying thing that we did is pay for 1,100 hours of developer time. Using that developer time, we’ve gotten a lot of stuff done. I can’t possibly cover everything in detail, but even an overview will give you a taste of what goes into keeping <code>bundle install</code> working month after month, and year after year.</p>

    <h3 id="bundler-accomplishments">bundler accomplishments</h3>
    <p>Working on Bundler, have completed and 5 feature releases. In <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2015/03/21/hello-bundler-19.html">Bundler 1.9</a>, we started using Molinillo, a new dependency manager. It was funded by a Stripe grant and shared between Bundler, RubyGems, and CocoaPods. In <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2015/06/24/version-1-10-released.html">Bundler 1.10</a>, we added the <code>lock</code> command, optional groups, conditional groups, and the ability to mute post-install messages per gem. (Finally, it’s possible to never be told “You must HTTParty hard” again!) In <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2015/12/12/version-1-11-released.html">Bundler 1.11</a>, we dramatically improved error messages both in general and when the Gemfile cannot be resolved. In <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2016/04/28/the-new-index-format-fastly-and-bundler-1-12.html">Bundler 1.12</a>, we finished a 3-year-long project and started using a new gem metadata file format that allows us to finally stop sending every user information about every gem every time they install. We also increased the speed of <code>bundle exec</code> and added support for locking and updating the Ruby version. In <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2016/09/08/bundler-1-13.html">Bundler 1.13</a>, we added support for gems with <code>required_ruby_version</code> for Gemfiles that declare their <code>ruby</code> version, added the <code>doctor</code> command to fix broken compiled gems, and added the ability to add and remove platforms you want Bundler to resolve for. And that was just a summary of the big features!</p>

    <p>We also released <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler/versions">38 bugfix releases</a>, completely <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2016/07/10/bundler-1-13-and-redesigned-bundler-io.html">redesigned the Bundler website</a>, and mentored nine <a href="http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> students and four <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org">RailsGirls Summer of Code</a> students across two summers.</p>

    <h3 id="now-rubygems-too">now rubygems, too</h3>
    <p>As part of keeping Bundler working, Ruby Together has taken over maintenance of the <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems">RubyGems project</a> as of 2016. Bundler already uses parts of RubyGems to install gems, and so it was a good fit. Even worse, ever since AT&amp;T Interactive shut down their Ruby open source department, RubyGems hasn’t had any dedicated development. For almost two years, the only significant change to RubyGems was a critical security fix.</p>

    <p>It was an awful situation. For that entire two years, installing compiled gems was broken on Windows for any Ruby version older than the latest. I’m very pleased to reveal that since the start of this year, we have fixed many bugs, including that one. Developers on Windows can install gems again. In total, we’ve released one minor and eight bugfix versions of RubyGems so far. We also have some great plans for RubyGems that I’ll cover in the section about the future, so keep reading!</p>

    <h3 id="oh-and-the-servers">oh and the servers</h3>
    <p>On the server side, we’ve done a huge amount of work on RubyGems.org and on the <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-api">Bundler dependency API</a>. I’ve previously given <a href="http://andre.arko.net/2013/12/09/extreme-makeover-rubygems-edition/">a talk about setting up the Bundler API </a> as a separate thing from RubyGems.org. It’s not in my talk, but the biggest reason we had to do that was that at that time RubyGems.org didn’t have enough volunteers to stay functional if it ran the Bundler API as well.</p>

    <p>Because of that shortage, the Bundler dependency API is a completely separate application from RubyGems.org. Even though we now have one team cooperating to run everything, we have had to keep paying the cost of two separate systems: one for the gem metadata, and one for the gems themselves.</p>

    <p>For the last year and a half, we’ve applied countless security patches and  implemented the server-side part of the <a href="http://andre.arko.net/2014/03/28/the-new-rubygems-index-format/">new index format</a> used by Bundler 1.12. We’ve even ported the entire Bundler API Sinatra app into the RubyGems.org Rails app. Someday very soon, we’ll only have one platform to keep operational. That’s a big win, giving us more reliability while requiring us to do less work. We also switched to using the <a href="http://fastly.com">Fastly CDN</a> for gem downloads, and we have ever so slowly reworked the entire architecture of RubyGems.org so that every page can be served from Fastly’s closest data center instead of from Amazon’s US-West region.</p>

    <p>On top of all of that proactive maintenance, we have paid developers to take on incident response. It’s much easier to prioritize keeping all of these systems operational when it’s paid work. Our team has handled around a dozen outages over the last 18 months, and every one of them has been shorter than it would have been without Ruby Together.</p>

    <h3 id="gemstash-also-pretty-neat">gemstash, also pretty neat</h3>
    <p>One more thing that we did: we built a new tool to help everyone manage the gems that they need. It’s called <a href="https://github.com/bundler/gemstash">Gemstash</a>, and it’s a server you can run that will cache every gem you download from RubyGems.org. You can run one on your local laptop to avoid downloading gems multiple times. You can run one in your office to speed up installing the gems your application needs. Or you can run one in your datacenter, and install gems across all your server from a local source. It can even act as a server for private gems, so you can keep your company’s internal gems on it, too.</p>

    <h3 id="bundler-20-is-coming">bundler 2.0 is coming</h3>
    <p>Later this fall, we’re going to release <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4853">Bundler 1.14</a>, and then <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4856">Bundler 2.0</a> after that. When we were designing Bundler 1.0, we made tradeoffs based on a world that didn’t use Bundler. Today, not only Ruby developers but developers in most languages have a dependency manager—the old tradeoffs are a problem now, instead of a benefit.</p>

    <p>Plus, it’s a huge drain on our time to keep supporting Ruby 1.8.7 and all the other ancient versions of Ruby and RubyGems that were new at the time Bundler was originally released. The functionality provided by Bundler won’t change, and everyone will be able to use Bundler 1 in some projects and Bundler 2 in others on the same machine. I’m really excited about the improvements that are possible with backwards-breaking changes, and I’m looking forward to sharing those with you later this year or early next year.</p>

    <h3 id="plus-were-going-to-merge-bundler-and-rubygems">plus we’re going to merge bundler and rubygems</h3>
    <p>Oh, and one more thing. For the last six years of working on Bundler, one of the most frustrating things about working on it has been the separation between Bundler and RubyGems. Sometimes making a change in one would break something in the other. The rest of the time it has just been a huge pain to make sure that they work to install gems the same way even when they aren’t working together.</p>

    <p>By talking to developers, companies, and the teams working on Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org, we’ve come up with a plan to combine the Bundler and RubyGems projects. They’ll still have separate commands, <code>gem</code> and <code>bundle</code>, but they’ll have a single codebase behind them. This summer, we mapped out everything that needed to be done for that merger, and started working on it.</p>

    <p>After Bundler 2 is released, the main focus of the Bundler and RubyGems teams will be merging the codebases together into <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1681">RubyGems+Bundler 3.0</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="somehow-its-working">somehow, it’s working!</h2>
    <p>In many ways, the last year and a half has been more successful than I could have dreamed. Ruby Together is paying developers for work every week. We’ve fixed more bugs and made more progress on Bundler and RubyGems in the last year than we managed in the three years before that. We started out especially strong, and we saw new companies and developers signing up every single month for an entire year.</p>

    <h3 id="but-its-not-all-good">but it’s not all good</h3>
    <p>But for the last six months, even as we’ve set new records for paid hours, while we managed the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> project for all of Ruby, and while we made these exciting plans to finally bring RubyGems and Bundler together… membership has been flat. We’ve seen a few new members, but a few members have left. Overall, we’re in the same place after 18 months as we were after 12 months: able to pay consistently for several hours a week, but not yet able to pay even two people part-time.</p>

    <h3 id="companies-are-short-sighted">companies are short-sighted</h3>
    <p>Businesses are ultimately answerable to shareholders who want profit, and right now businesses think that they can get the benefits of Ruby community infrastructure and tools without needing to contribute back themselves. It’s always worked before, right?</p>

    <p>Just because it’s worked in the past doesn’t mean it will keep working in the future. As I showed earlier, the demands of the community keep growing. The situation we have now is unsustainable. RubyGems was broken on Windows for two years! Everyone in the Ruby community needs to know about the crisis that we’re heading towards. Every company in the community needs to understand that we can’t keep giving them a free ride even if we wanted to.</p>

    <p>Some companies (like <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="http://codeminer42.com">CodeMiner42</a>, <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://travis-ci.com">Travis</a>, and others) have stepped up to support us with actual money. Other companies tell us it’s a great initiative, and they’re really glad we exist, but they’re not willing to pitch in. We haven’t seen any new companies join for almost six months. If that keeps up, we won’t even be able to keep up paying for a few hours of work per week. If companies keep taking community benefits without giving back, it takes us straight back to unsustainable volunteers burning themselves out.</p>

    <h3 id="cooperating-is-good-for-everyone">cooperating is good for everyone</h3>
    <p>We don’t want that! There’s a better way. It’s not even hard, or expensive. At Ruby Together, we’re already prepared to keep everything working—we just need support from Ruby developers and companies to make that possible.</p>

    <p>We offer the entire community a great deal: free tools and free hosting for Ruby code they want to share with the world. We offer a fantastic deal for companies, too: the benefits of full-time infrastructure developers at a tiny fraction of the cost.</p>

    <p>So for now, we’re asking: help us work on <a href="https://bundler.io">Bundler</a>, <a href="https://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a>, and everything else by <a href="https://rubytogether.org/join">signing up</a>. Everything we build with money from the community is shared back to the community, and that’s what Ruby Together is all about.</p>

    <p>Welcome to the Ruby Together update for August 2016. This month, we paid for 65.5 hours of work, had 2 new members join. We released Bundler 1.13 RC2, and created roadmaps for Bundler 1.13, 1.14, 2.0, and RubyGems + Bundler 3.0.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>This August at Ruby Together was marked by personnel shifts. The Google Summer of Code students finished their term, with 12 students successfully completing their projects. The Rails Girls Summer of Code students shifted up their work, submitting their first PR. Our ops engineer’s wife had a child (congrats, David + family!) and our project manager had a major surgery.</p>

    <p>We had two new developer members join, but no companies. If your company needs Bundler and RubyGems to function, talk to your team about Ruby Together! We need support from companies to keep everything working smoothly.</p>

    <p>Voting for the board of directors wrapped up this month. After an incredibly close election, board members <a href="http://twitter.com/randommood">Ines Sombra</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/coralineada">Coraline Ada Ehmke</a> were re-elected to a three year term. Thanks to every member who participated! &lt;3</p>

    <p>Ruby Together employees also worked on a variety of smaller tools in the Ruby development ecosystem, including <a href="https://github.com/how-is/how_is">how-is</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr">vcr</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/indirect/lita-tweet">lita</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>We ironed out more bugs with Bundler 1.13, and arrived at <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1130rc2-2016-08-21">1.13.rc2</a>. Andre created checklists for upcoming versions of Bundler, including <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4852">1.13</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4853">1.14</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4856">2.0</a>. <a href="https://bundler.io">Bundler.io</a> got its last set of changes courtesy of Google Summer of Code, and will be returning to its mountain lair where it lies in wait for more motivated contributors.</p>

    <p>In total, Bundler had 53 merged pull requests and 184 commits from 18 authors, and closed 44 issues.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems.org got its regular maintenance work, and updates to address security vulnerabilities in the <code>gem yank</code> command. With those changes, RubyGems.org had 18 merged pull requests and 26 commits from 7 authors.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems got a lot of planning work done towards the 3.0 merge, and now has <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1681">an issue</a> to track merger considerations. Including that work, RubyGems had 10 merged pull requests and 10 commits from 5 authors.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>From July 19 to August 18, Ruby Together took in $18577. In total, we spent $22637.63. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$3930 for 26.2 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3795 for 25.3 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$2100 for 14.0 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$74.2 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$582.04 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$3668.53 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>
      <li>$6315.0 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$2172.86 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="next-month">next month</h2>

    <p>Look forward next month to us capitalizing on the release planning work, and the efforts of our Rails Girls Summer of Code students!</p>

    <p>Welcome to the Ruby Together update for July 2016. This month, we paid for 64.4 hours of work, had 5 new members join, and had another solid month from our summer coding students. Work done this month includes a new design for bundler.io, and a lot of progress towards Bundler 1.13, 1.14, 2.0, and the combined Bundler+RubyGems 3.0.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>The focus at RubyTogether this month was on coordinating work across our largest team ever, thanks to all of our summer coding students. The biggest event was <a href="https://github.com/kruczjak">@kruczjak</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sailorhg">@sailorhg</a>’s work on the <a href="http://bundler.io">bundler.io</a> redesign, which dramatically updated the style and added an array of new functionality. The highlights of that work are detailed in <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2016/07/10/bundler-1-13-and-redesigned-bundler-io.html">@kruczjak’s post announcing the new design</a>.</p>

    <p>Along with that we had other <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google Summer of Code</a> students working on a variety of small Bundler features, and the <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a> students gearing up to working on Bundler’s analytics system. Finally we had <a href="https://github.com/segiddins">@segiddins</a> working on future Bundler / RubyGems updates, <a href="https://github.com/duckinator/">@duckinator</a> on <a href="https://github.com/how-is">how-is</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/LynnCo">@lynnco</a> on administrative automation.</p>

    <p>We had two 5 new members join this month, including 3 new developers and 2 new companies. We appreciate everyone getting the word out, and encouraging people to support the Ruby community!</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>This was a very busy month for Bundler, with 15 authors getting 35 merged PRs with 251 commits. Features include: <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4770">RubyGems / Bundler Integration</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4650">respecting the required Ruby version</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4741">a warning message / upgrade guide</a> for Bundler 2.0, <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4753">trampolining fixes</a> which will allow Bundler 2.0 to stay compatible with apps that use Bundler 1.x, and <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4676">bundler-patch</a>. Most of that work will be shipping with Bundler release 1.13 (any day now), and 1.14 (coming soon after, likely next month).</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems.org this month was mostly <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1359">content updates</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1342">minor security changes</a>. Notably, though, we got a first time open source contributor! <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1361">They added</a> a Twitter field to RubyGems.org user profiles. In total we had 9 authors working on 27 merges with 67 commits.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems this month was mostly <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1666">minor</a> <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1659">fixes</a>, across 1 author (our own <a href="https://github.com/segiddins">Samuel Giddins</a>), 3 merges, and 10 commits. Near the end of this month, the <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1639">first</a> of what will likely be many Bundler / RubyGems PRs was resolved, moving us closer to Bundler / RubyGems 3.0.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>From June 21 to July 19, Ruby Together took in $19,161. In total, we spent $18,563.86. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$2,452 for 16.3 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,613 for 24.1 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,600 for 24.0 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$74.35 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$596.57 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$1544.71 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>
      <li>$7275.0 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$29.0 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Check back next month for our last month of work from Google Summer of Code, more work towards major releases, and our regular diligent security updates and minor fixes.</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />

    <p>Welcome to the June 2016 monthly update for Ruby Together! In the last month, we paid for 119.6 hours of work, and had 6 new members join. Our work this month includes RubyGems 2.6.6, Bundler 1.13 pre-release, and an array of minor improvements thanks to our Google Summer of Code students.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <h3 id="tools-for-our-tools">tools for our tools</h3>

    <p>We worked on two meta tools: <a href="https://github.com/duckinator/how_is">How Is</a> for checking the status of issues and pull requests, and <a href="https://github.com/patronus-io/patronus">Patronus</a> for testing and merging pull requests. Their broad goal is to take some of the legwork out of maintaining Bundler and RubyGems.</p>

    <h3 id="summer-of-coders">summer of coders</h3>

    <p>Our Google Summer of Code (<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">GSoC</a>) students have done an array of work including an initial release of the plugin system, Bundler’s site redesign, and resolving many <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=label%3AGSoC%20">other issues</a>. They are going pretty strong as we head into GSoC’s midterms. We also got approval for a second set of summer assistance, and so next month we will be working with a team from <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-06-24-more-teams-aye">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="new-members">new members</h3>

    <p>We had a total of 7 new members this month, including 5 developers: Joseph Method, Daisuke Goto, George Claghorn, Joseph D. Marhee, and Aditya Sanghi. The 2 companies that joined this month are: <a href="http://www.powershop.co.nz/">Powershop</a> and <a href="https://envato.com">Envato</a></p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>Bundler <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1130pre1-2016-06-20">1.13</a> got a pre-release this month, featuring a set of <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4580">significant speed improvements</a> ported from <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo/pull/40">CocoaPods</a>. 1.13 also includes an alpha version of the <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4608">plugin system</a>, which will likely see a full release in 1.14.</p>

    <p>Recently <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-api">Bundler-api</a> (the server side code for Bundler) has started <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems-infrastructure/issues/42">being moved</a> into RubyGems.org infrastructure. This change was made to reduce duplication of effort and resources, but also fits into the general goal of an eventual Bundler and RubyGems merge.</p>

    <p>Finally this month saw <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/pull/218">a lot of work</a> towards the new design for <a href="https://bundler.io">bundler.io</a>.</p>

    <p>In total, Bundler had 40 merged pull requests and 226 commits from 15 authors, and we closed 49 issues.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>In addition to the standard Fastly optimizations, the RubyGems.org team started working towards
    better policies and more security.

  slug: may-2016-monthly-update
  layout_id: 2
  content_cache: |2+


    <p>Welcome to the May 2016 monthly update for Ruby Together. In the last month, we paid for 232.3 hours of developer, designer, and project management time (twice as high as the previous record!). With that time we released several patches for Bundler 1.12, optimized and improved fallback for the Bundler API and RubyGems.org, and introduced over a dozen new people to working on Bundler / RubyGems. We also saw six new members join, including three companies.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>This month at Ruby Together was all about people. We went to <a href="http://railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a>, kicked off <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google Summer of Code</a> student projects, and started reorganizing Bundler and RubyGems issues. At RailsConf, both <a href="https://github.com/bundler/gemstash">Gemstash</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/adoption-center">RubyGems Adoption Center</a>) got shoutouts and work from attendees. Andre and Samuel also started working with the Google Summer of Code students on a variety of Bundler and RubyGems issues.</p>

    <p>We paid for 118.4 hours of time spent on Bundler. That time was primarily focused on bugfixes for Bundler’s 1.12 release, and also laid the groundwork for Google Summer of Code students to start working on several different projects. Lynn reorganized Bundler’s issues and Trello boards so that more information is public and accessible. Finally, we received nomination(s) for board members this month and will be holding an election to decide the state of the new Ruby Together board.</p>

    <p>We had three new developers join as members: James Wen, Adam Becker, and Asad Akbar. Three companies joined: <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">Thoughtbot</a>, <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/">Geckoboard</a>, and <a href="https://www.sabre.com/">Sabre Corp</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">Thoughtbot</a> is a consulting company with small teams of designers and developers in 10 cities around the world, making software for clients, and contributing to open source software.</p>

    <p>Although <a href="http://icelab.com.au/">Icelab</a> joined us last month, we forgot to mention them in last month’s newsletter, so here they are: <a href="http://icelab.com.au/">Icelab</a> is a studio in Australia with a team of problem solvers who want to work with you to build a better world. They work with Ruby every day, and do their best to push Ruby forward through our support of the <a href="http://dry-rb.org/">dry-rb</a> project.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>This month we released <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">Bundler 1.12.1 - 1.12.5</a>. These changes were mainly bug fixes for the new index format, but we also fixed several issues running Bundler on continuous integration servers. We also worked on upcoming releases this month, specifically breaking changes for Bundler 2.0 and the plugin system that’s been in progress for some time now. On the <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-api">Bundler-api</a> side, we set up a new follower database and then promoted it to primary status. The new primary database means we’ll be able to avoid downtime when AWS services the old primary database later this month.</p>

    <p>In total, <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler">Bundler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-api">Bundler-api</a> had 25 merged pull requests and 119 commits from 10 authors, and we closed 53 closed issues.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems.org had 24 merged pull requests and 59 commits from 13 authors. We implemented <a href="http://blog.rubygems.org/2016/05/19/simplifying-our-stack.html">a variety of infrastructure changes</a> this month, including serving our millions of gem requests directly from Fastly, reducing our reliance on Nginx and completely eliminating Redis from our stack. Next up is porting the Bundler API’s new index format, working towards our goal of a single unified application to serve the entire site.</p>

    <p>This month the team also <a href="http://blog.rubygems.org/2016/05/20/rubygems-org-2016-push.html">blogged about ways to improve RubyGems.org for 2016</a> by increasing contributors, updating policies, and decreasing response times on support issues. Many of the issues described there are due to RubyGems support having been run by volunteers, which Ruby Together is working on addressing! The financial support of Ruby community members like you is making all of this possible. &lt;3</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>In the last month, RubyGems merged 13 pull requests, containing 15 commits by 8 authors. We’re continuing to work our way through outstanding issues, planning the future merger of Bundler with RubyGems, and evaluating what we can do to make RubyGems more useful to everyone who depends on it.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>From April 19 to May 19, Ruby Together took in $17,956. In total, we spent $58,330.67. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$17,752.50 for 118.4 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$6,900.00 for 46 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$10,187.50 for 67.9 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$76.19 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$563.08 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$5,729.31 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>
      <li>$1,920.00 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$15,145.53 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We spent more than usual this month thanks to a combination of onboarding new volunteers and Google Summer of Code students, our newest employees ramping up, filing tax returns, attending RailsConf, doing more direct outreach to companies, and working on the Ruby Together store (coming soon!). Look forward to seeing the efforts of our hardworking Google Summer of Code students next month, as well as results from our focused outreach efforts!</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />
    Lynn, André, and the Ruby Together team</p>

    <p>Hello there, and welcome to the Ruby Together monthly update for April 2016! In the last month, we paid for 106 hours of developer time (another new record!). With that time, we handled <a href="http://blog.rubygems.org/2016/04/06/gem-replacement-vulnerability-and-mitigation.html">a big security issue on RubyGems.org</a> and released new versions of Bundler and RubyGems. We also had six new members join, including five companies.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <h3 id="meet-us-get-swag-railsconf-edition">meet us, get swag (RailsConf edition)</h3>

    <p>In May, André will be speaking at <a href="https://www.railsconf.com">RailsConf 2016</a> in Kansas City, MO. He’ll be giving a talk titled Don’t Forget The Network: Your App Is Slower Than You Think. If you’ll be there, say hello! He’ll have Bundler stickers and Ruby Together shirts and stickers.</p>

    <h3 id="new-members">new members</h3>

    <p>This month six new members joined. One individual member, Ryan Buckley, and five companies: <a href="http://www.icelab.com/">Icelab</a>, <a href="https://metabahn.com/">Metabahn</a>, <a href="https://www.tommyjohn.com/">Tommy John</a>, and <a href="https://www.superborrownet.com/">SuperBorrowNet</a>, and <a href="https://abletech.nz/">Abletech</a>. Thanks for helping spread the word about Ruby Together to our new members!</p>

    <h3 id="new-hires">new hires</h3>

    <p>This month, we hired a project manager and a developer evangelist! <a href="https://twitter.com/lynncyrin">Lynn Cyrin</a> will be working on making sure code releases and update posts happen in a timeline fashion, generating roadmaps, and generally bring order to chaos. <a href="https://twitter.com/parndt">Phil Arndt</a> will be representing Ruby Together to companies (mainly in Australia and New Zealand), handing out stickers and helping companies become members.</p>

    <h3 id="one-year-anniversary-and-board-elections">one year anniversary (and board elections)</h3>

    <p>It’s our birthday! Ruby Together has been around for an entire year. It’s been a really busy year, but we’ve gotten a lot of great stuff done. In our first year, we’ve handled security issues and outages on RubyGems.org and released new versions of Bundler and RubyGems as well as implementing the new index format. We also created and released <a href="https://github.com/bundler/gemstash">Gemstash</a>, a server anyone can run to host private gem, or caching public ones. We’re extremely proud of what we’ve managed to accomplish in our first year, and we’re planning to get even more done in year two!</p>

    <p>As part of being one year old, it’s time for the yearly board elections. The first step in those elections is nominations. If you’re a member and you want to nominate someone for election to the Ruby Together board, you can! Fill out the <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/iYgnMVGswj">board member nomination form</a> and give us all of your suggestions. Next month, members will vote to decide who will represent them for the next year.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>This month we released <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2016/04/28/the-new-index-format-fastly-and-bundler-1-12.html">Bundler 1.12</a>! Excitingly, this is the first release to use the <a href="http://andre.arko.net/2014/03/28/the-new-rubygems-index-format/">new index format</a>. Designing the new index, implementing a server and a client, and rolling it out has taken over two years, but it’s finally done. The new index format means that <code>bundle install</code> will be noticeably faster (especially when no new gems versions have been released since the last time you installed). The server-side is also hugely improved, since all the gem data is served by the Fastly CDN from a data center near you, all around the world.</p>

    <p>We also saw 29 merged pull requests and 67 commits from 8 authors for the Bundler client and server. Finally, we created a set of <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/milestones">milestones</a> for how Bundler will progress for 1.13, 1.14, and on to 3.0.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems.org got 13 merge requests and 85 commits from 8 authors. This month involved a lot of cleanup work, and a little bit of infrastructure changes to support the Bundler index format.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems">RubyGems</a> has 15 merged pull requests and 24 commits from 10 authors. RubyGems released <a href="http://blog.rubygems.org/2016/04/26/2.6.4-released.html">version 2.6.4</a> featuring symlinks on Windows, and using less hard coded strings. RubyGems releases have been fairly consistent since 2.5.2 at the beginning of this year, and we intent to keep them that way!</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>From March 20 to April 18, Ruby Together took in $16,645. In total, we spent $26,881.32. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$4,050 for 27 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$5,850 for 39 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$5,970 for 39.8 hours of developer time on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$75.81 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$523.51 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$1927.29 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>
      <li>$0 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$9,003.22 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some evangelism and outreach work over the past six months had gone unbilled, and we were able to settle all accounts this month. Next month, we expect to continue spending more than usual on outreach, because of our new hire and attending RailsConf to spread the word about Ruby Together.</p>

    <p>Check back next month to hear about board member elections, as well as the results of our new hires this month. By that time we will also have rolled out a set of plans for how we intend on updating Bundler, RubyGems, and Ruby Together in general. Towards the future!</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />
    André, Lynn, and the Ruby Together team</p>

    <p>Hello, everyone! Welcome to the March 2016 monthly update for Ruby Together. This month, we paid for 68.25 developer hours, and had 6 new members join. We continued to make forward progress in every project, and quickly restored service after an outage in the RubyGems Dependency API. Keep an eye out for release announcements from Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org, since we plan to keep them coming. If you’re not a member yet, help us do even more work for the community by <a href="https://rubytogether.org">joining today</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="meet-us-get-stickers">Meet us, get stickers</h2>

    <p>This week, André will be attending Ruby on Ales in Bend, OR. He’ll also be giving a talk on the first day of the conference about ways to avoid driving contributors away from your open source project (or company’s engineering team). If you’ll be there, say hello! He’ll have lots of Ruby Together stickers to give away.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">Ruby Together News</h2>

    <p>In the last month, we’ve been working hard—Ruby Together paid for 68.25 developer hours. We spent that time on Bundler, RubyGems, RubyGems.org, and Google Summer of Code for Ruby. We had six new members join: Tom Johnson, Francis Luong (Franco), Patrick McSweeny, Dan Sherson, Andrew Nesbitt, and Jeffrey Baird.</p>

    <p>The bad news is that no new companies joined last month, for the first time since Ruby Together was started. If your company hasn’t joined yet, this would be a good time to encourage them! On the other hand, the good news is that even with no new corporate members, we can afford to pay for 25 hours of development work every week. That’s 100 hours of maintenance and improvements every month on Ruby community infrastructure that was previously being done without compensation, or more likely not being done at all.</p>

    <p>In other news, the GSoC student application deadline was this Friday, and we’ve spent much of the month communicating with students about potential projects and their proposals. In all, we received 41 applications, including projects in Bundler, RubyGems.org, Rails, JRuby, and MRI itself.</p>

    <p>Over the next month, we’ll be reviewing proposals and requesting slots from Google for the students we want to accept. Last year, we were able to work with every student whose proposal we decided to accept. Hopefully we’ll be able to do that again this year, too.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">Bundler News</h2>

    <p>Bundler got a fair amount of ongoing maintenance this month, with 45 new commits and 24 merged pull requests from 12 different authors. We also finished the prerelease cycle for Bundler 1.12, and pushed the release candidate to RubyGems.org. If we don’t find any bugs, it will be the final version! Give it a try by running <code>gem install bundler --pre</code> and [let us know] if you run into any problems.</p>

    <p>On the Bundler API side of things, we saw 24 new commits and 13 merged pull requests from 7 authors. When the API started [returning 503 responses last week], we were able to investigate, mitigate the issue by adding capacity, continue monitoring, and completely resolve the problem the next day. We also added a graph of API responses to [the RubyGems.org status page] so that future issues will be easier to see. Everything is back to working smoothly, and no one had to take unpaid time off of work to do it, thanks to your support for Ruby Together! Good work, everyone.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">RubyGems.org News</h2>

    <p>The RubyGems.org repo saw 15 pull requests merged, including 99 commits from 10 authors. We added a new application server, fixed a bevy of small issues, and shipped the new download counting setup that works with Fastly from staging to production! If everything goes according to plan, all of RubyGems.org will be served directly from Fastly within the next month.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">RubyGems News</h2>

    <p>RubyGems saw some nice progress as well, with 20 pull requests merged, containing 33 commits from 9 authors. Fixes included finding the right gem on different platforms, finding the right gem executable stub, and always running the newest installed version of a gem. We released RubyGems version 2.6.2 with some of those fixes, and we’ll be releasing 2.6.3 shortly with the rest of them.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>

    <p>From Feburary 20 to March 19, Ruby Together took in $18,140. In total, we spent $13,437.96. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$4,275 for 28.5 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,112.50 for 20.75 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$2,850 for 19 hours of developer time on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$73.52 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$566.86 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$1,561.81 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>
      <li>$210 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$788.27 on community outreach, including stickers, shirts, and speaking at conferences</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Over the next month, we plan to ship two big, long-term projects! Work on Bundler 1.12 and the new index format started three years ago, and work on serving RubyGems.org entirely through Fastly started over a year ago. It’s amazing that we’ve managed to accomplish changes requiring years of work—and it’s because of your help.</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />
    André and the Ruby Together team</p>

    <p>Hello, and welcome to the monthly update for February 2016. This month, we paid for 86.4 hours of developer time (a new record!), and had 7 new members join, including BoochTek and Minnesota Public Radio. We also had our Ruby Google Summer of Code team accepted for 2016!</p>

    <p>If you’re not a member yet, help us do even more next month by <a href="https://rubytogether.org/join">joining today</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">Ruby Together news</h2>

    <p>February saw us set a new record for developer hours, with 86.4 paid hours worked on Bundler, the RubyGems.org servers, and RubyGems itself.</p>

    <p>Ruby Together also applied to <a href="http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> for Ruby as a whole (including MRI, Bundler, RubyGems, and other gems). Acceptances were just announced today, and Ruby was accepted! If you’re interested in participating in GSoC, either as a student or a mentor, <a href="https://bundler-slackin.herokuapp.com">join the Bundler Slack</a> and let us know. We’d love to work with you this summer.</p>

    <p>In February, we had four developers join as members, including Lamont Granquist, Nic Boie, Tara Scherner de la Fuente, and Jon Daniel. Two new companies joined, <a href="http://boochtek.com">BoochTek</a> and <a href="http://www.mpr.org">Minnesota Public Radio</a>. With these new members, our projected monthly income is now $17,120.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">Bundler news</h2>

    <p>Across the Bundler and Bundler API projects, 50 pull requests were merged, including 123 commits from 13 authors. Work on the next release of Bundler continued as planned: we released not one but two prereleases of Bundler 1.12. As a result, anyone can start using the new index today by running <code>gem install bundler --pre</code>. Try it out and let us know how it works for you!</p>

    <p>As long as no new issues come to light, we’ll be releasing Bundler 1.12 final in about two weeks. It’s honestly kind of astonishing to contemplate the idea that it will finally be released, almost three years after starting to work on it.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">RubyGems.org news</h2>

    <p>In the <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/">rubygems.org repo</a>, 15 pull requests were merged, including 80 commits from 9 authors. We applied security patches, upgraded gems, fixed bugs, and removed a dependency on Flash.</p>

    <p>We also shipped the first version of the Fastly log processor to the staging environment. Once it’s live in production, we’ll be able to move all gem downloads to point directly at a CDN endpoint, rather than serving redirects to the CDN from our servers on EC2.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">RubyGems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems continued to make significant progress, catching up on the backlog of outstanding issues. We closed 51 issues, leaving only 108 remaining. We also merged 35 pull requests, including 69 commits from 15 authors.</p>

    <p>Some highlights from those changes include support for Ruby 2.3’s frozen string literals, better support for pushing to gem hosts other than rubygems.org, and many miscellaneous fixes released as RubyGems <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/History.txt#L3">version 2.6</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>

    <p>From January 19 to February 19, including Travis CI paying up front for an entire year, Ruby Together took in $18,556.94. In total, we spent $21,355.40. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$4,500 for 30 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$2,887.50 for 19.25 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$7,075 for 41.67 hours of developer time on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$73.20 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$493.63 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$274.58 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>
      <li>$70 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$5,530.02 on community outreach, including stickers, shirts, and speaking at conferences</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As mentioned in last month’s newsletter, this month’s community outreach spending actually covers multiple months, due to reimbursement delays.</p>

    <p>Next month, keep an eye out for more progress on RubyGems and the Bundler 1.12 release, bringing the new index format to Rubyists around the world!</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />

    <p>Welcome to the Ruby Together monthly update for January 2016! This month we paid for 55.65 hours of developer time, 7 new developers joined as members, and 2 new companies joined: Simplificator AG and Travis CI.</p>

    <p>If you’re not a member yet, help us do even more next month by <a href="https://rubytogether.org/join">joining today</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">Ruby Together news</h2>

    <p>The end of December and January were a pretty quiet time, as usual for most businesses around the world. While it was quiet, we were still working away, and we have hired two more developers to work on Ruby gem infrastructure! Bundler maintainer <a href="https://twitter.com/segiddins">Samuel E. Giddins</a> will be working on both Bundler and RubyGems when his studies permit. Also stepping in to give a hand with RubyGems work is <a href="http://twitter.com/duckinator">Ellen Marie Dash</a>. See below for the results on RubyGems—we’re making good progress.</p>

    <p>We had seven new developers join as members, including Sean Moubry, Simon Starr, Veronica Ray, Terry Finn, Barrett Clark, and Chris Thorn. Two companies joined, <a href="http://www.simplificator.com/en">Simplificator AG</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis CI</a>. Travis CI has been a long-time supporter of Ruby open source, and provides free infrastructure to run the tests for Bundler, RubyGems, RubyGems.org, and countless other open source projects. With these new members, our projected monthly income is now $16,830.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">Bundler news</h2>

    <p>Between finals and holiday vacations, work on Bundler was sporadic, but we made significant progress. Across the Bundler and Bundler API projects, 49 pull requests were merged, including 239 commits from 10 authors.</p>

    <p>The Bundler API servers are now serving the new RubyGems index format, and the Bundler master branch has merged the new index client code. With only a few known issues left, we expect to ship a prerelease of Bundler 1.12 within the next week or two!</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">RubyGems.org news</h2>

    <p>In the <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/">rubygems.org repo</a>, 13 pull requests were merged, including 82 commits from 10 authors. We applied security patches, upgraded gems, fixed bugs, and improved translations on the site. We also built and deployed a completely new status page at http://status.rubygems.org. It is more accurate, and should also be more reliable.</p>

    <p>In addition to improving the codebase, we improved exception reporting, dealt with sporadic CDN outages, blocked abusive traffic that threatened to take down the site, and generally worked to keep things running smoothly.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">RubyGems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems is the most exciting project to me in this update, since it is getting seriously worked on for the first time in several months. We closed 50 issues, leaving only 131 remaining. We also merged 17 pull requests, including 31 commits from 9 authors.</p>

    <p>Some highlights from those changes include fixing <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/977">a longstanding bug with native gems</a>, adding Windows CI for the RubyGems, and many miscellaneous fixes released as RubyGems <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/History.txt#L3">version 2.5.2</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>

    <p>From December 19 to January 18, including Travis CI paying up front for an entire year, Ruby Together took in $25,766. In total, we spent $10,346.25. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$2,347.50 for 15.65 hours of developer time on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$73.72 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$507.31 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$1,211.44 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>
      <li>$280 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We spent around $2,500 on community outreach costs, including stickers, shirts, conferences, and etc., but reimbursements went out too late to be included here. We’ll include them in next month’s budget summary.</p>

    <p>Next month, we expect an increase in community outreach as we ramp up operations in the new year. We also expect to pay for between 60 and 100 developer hours, an all-time high.</p>

    <p>In the next update: Bundler 1.12, the new RubyGems index format, and further results from reviewing the years-long backlog of RubyGems issues!</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />
    André and the Ruby Together team</p>

  content_cache: "\n\n<p>Happy new year, everyone! Just in time to wrap up 2015, this
    is the monthly update for December 2015. In the last month, we paid for 40 hours
    of work on Bundler and RubyGems.org, 2 developers joined, and 4 companies joined.
    The end of the year is always a quiet time, but we were still able to make some
    great progress.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-together-news\">Ruby Together news</h2>\n\n<p>The
    biggest news is that we’ve started to pay for work on <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems\">RubyGems</a>!
    The <code>gem</code> command and associated libraries, which ship as part of Ruby
    itself, will get some love from <a href=\"https://github.com/copiousfreetime/\">Jeremy
    Hinegardner</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/krainboltgreene\">Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene</a>.
    Hooray! \U0001F389</p>\n\n<p>We were also joined by two new developer members,
    including Brian Buchalter, and 4 new companies, including <a href=\"https://appcanary.com\">Appcanary</a>
    and <a href=\"http://bitcrowd.net\">bitcrowd</a>. With these new members, our
    total monthly income is now projected to be $16,620 per month. As this amount
    increases, we plan to increase developer hours spent on Bundler, RubyGems and
    RubyGems.org, moving from 15 hours per week towards full-time work on Ruby infrastructure.
    If you’re not a member yet, help us reach that goal by <a href=\"https://rubytogether.org/join\">joining
    today</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bundler-news\">Bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>The last month
    was very productive for Bundler. We released <a href=\"http://bundler.io/blog/2015/12/12/version-1-11-released.html\">Bundler
    1.11</a>. The biggest new features are the error messages: our goal is to never
    show an exception and backtrace while running the <code>bundle</code> command,
    and instead print a message that explains what the problem is and suggests solutions
    if any are available. This release was a huge step in that direction. We now catch
    many, many errors that were previously uncaught, especially ones around filesystem
    permissions and access problems.</p>\n\n<p>The other big error message improvement
    was in the resolver. When your Gemfile contains gems that can’t all be installed
    together, the error message will now show every gem’s current version, the version
    you asked for, and the versions that ultimately conflicted. It doesn’t happen
    a lot, but when it does, the new messages make it much, much easier to resolve
    the problem.</p>\n\n<p>The third big feature of 1.11 wasn’t actually a feature:
    we fixed bugs. Lots of bugs. We fixed over 50 bugs, making this version of Bundler
    the most stable one we have ever released. To start using Bundler 1.11 today,
    just run <code>gem install bundler</code>, and you’re good to go! All told, in
    the last months 9 different authors pushed 199 new commits, working on Bundler
    version 1.11 and upcoming versions 1.12 and 2.0.</p>\n\n<p>Next month, we’ll be
    working hard on Bundler 1.12, with support for <a href=\"http://andre.arko.net/2014/03/28/the-new-rubygems-index-format/\">new
    RubyGems index format</a>! It’s really exciting to see more than two years of
    work finally paying off with increased speed and reliability.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">RubyGems.org
    news</h2>\n\n<p>In the last month, 10 authors pushed 54 commits to the RubyGems.org
    and RubyGems infrastructure repositories. We improved search, added a new API
    endpoint with information about single versions of gems, improved the copywriting
    on the site itself, and dramatically improved the Spanish translation.</p>\n\n<p>We
    also settled on the final plan for processing download counts with Fastly, and
    started working on the implementation. Once that stats system is set up, we’ll
    be ready to switch the entire RubyGems.org site over to be served by Fastly.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"budget--expenses\">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>\n\n<p>From November 19 to December
    18, including Airbnb paying up front for an entire year, Ruby Together took in
    $28,775. In total, we spent $12,366.34. Here’s a breakdown of where the money
    went:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\n
    \ <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\n

    design, and other professional services</li>\n  <li>$3,310.92 on community outreach
    including stickers, conferences, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We made great progress
    on Bundler and RubyGems.org this month. Check back next month to hear about Bundler
    1.12, the RubyGems.org Fastly migration, and the results of Ruby Together starting
    to pay for work on RubyGems and the <code>gem</code> command!</p>\n\n<p>Until

    <p>Hello, and welcome to the Ruby Together update for the month of November! This was an extremely eventful month: we paid for 40 hours of development work on Bundler and RubyGems.org, and we were joined by a record 17 (!) new members. We also added a new Ruby Together team member, spoke at RubyConf 2015 in San Antonio, Texas, and lots more.</p>

    <p>Keep reading to hear about everything we managed to do this month, and if you’re not a member yet, <a href="https://rubytogether.org/#join">sign up today!</a> to help us get even more done.</p>

    <h3 id="ruby-together-news">Ruby Together news</h3>

    <p>This month, the biggest news is that we have a new Ruby Together team member! <a href="https://twitter.com/cczona">Carina Zona</a>, noted developer evangelist and public speaker, will be helping us spread the word about Ruby Together.</p>

    <p>Carina gave the opening keynote at RubyConf 2015, and helmed the Ruby Together exhibitor table. André also spoke at RubyConf, and occasionally manned the table as well. At our RubyConf table, we distributed shirts, stickers, and information to anyone who was interested.</p>

    <p>The Ruby Together shirts were extremely popular, with all 250 gone in less than an hour! They were so popular, in fact, that we’re going to be launching a new site where everyone can get their hands on one in a design and size that makes them happy.</p>

    <p>There were eight new developers who joined us since last update, including Leo Liang, Abdullah Esmail, and Kazuho Yamaguchi, Ryan Bigg, Ravil Bayramgalin, Teng Siong Ong, Jason Charnes, and Nikki Murray.</p>

    <p>Nine new companies signed up, including <a href="http://www.codeminer42.com/">CodeMiner 42</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, <a href="http://www.appfolioinc.com/">AppFolio</a>, <a href="https://www.kindlyops.com/">Kindly Ops</a>, <a href="http://binarynoggin.com/">Binary Noggin</a>, and <a href="https://appcanary.com/">Appcanary</a>. CodeMiner 42 deserves a special shout-out for being the second company ever at the Sapphire level, along with Stripe.</p>

    <p>Thank you to everyone who signed up! With the new memberships, our projected monthly income has now reached $16,550 per month.</p>

    <div class="clear"><img alt="$16,550 per month means 2-3 devs at 5 hours per week" src="https://rubytogether.org/email/2015-11-30-november-2015-monthly-update/roadmap-status.png" width="520" /></div>

    <h3 id="bundler-news">Bundler news</h3>

    <p>This was a great month for Bundler, as well. A prerelease of version 1.11 has been pushed to RubyGems.org, and anyone can use it with <code>gem install bundler --pre</code>. In a week or so, once we’ve seen it working in the wild, we’ll update the website at <a href="http://bundler.io">bundler.io</a> and announce the changes with a full blog post there. In the meantime, here’s a brief summary of what’s new:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Dramatically improved messages on permission errors</li>
      <li>Resolver conflict messages now show the conflicting version numbers</li>
      <li>Git repos using HTTP can have credentials set via <code>bundle config</code></li>
      <li>Update gems without installing them using <code>bundle lock --update</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This release also lays the groundwork for version 1.12, which will include the (nearly complete!) new index changes, and is on its way to you as fast as is humanly possible.</p>

    <p>The Bundler team also released <a href="https://github.com/bundler/gemstash">Gemstash</a> a completely new project that’s been in the works for a while. Gemstash is mainly the work of <a href="https://github.com/smellsblue">@smellsblue</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pcarranza">@pcarranza</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/indirect">@indirect</a>.</p>

    <p>Gemstash can act as a gem caching server, storing copies of the gems you need from RubyGems.org. This can be particularly useful if you have an office full of pairing machines, a data center full of app servers, or any other time when you need to install the same gems onto many machines. By running Gemstash locally, you can download that gem from far-off RubyGems.org just once, and then install it from Gemstash after that. Much faster.</p>

    <p>The other big thing Gemstash offers is private gem hosting. If your company has been using private git repos in order to avoid an internal gem server, or if you have an internal gem server that never seems to work correctly, start using Gemstash! Git gems require copying the entire history of every gem, which includes a lot of data that is never used, so releasing private gems can speed things up.</p>

    <h3 id="rubygems-news">RubyGems news</h3>

    <p>The Bundler news was really long, so I’ll try to keep the RubyGems.org news brief: we applied security updates, merged pull requests, upgraded gems, migrated to a new version of Chef, worked on the Fastly migration, handled an (accidental-looking) DoS attack, and generally kept everything running smoothly. If progress with the Fastly transition continues at this rate, we should be completely moved over within the next two or three months.</p>

    <p>Eagle eyes may have noticed that this section used to be called “RubyGems.org news”, but is now called “RubyGems news”. That’s because Ruby Together is also going to be able fund work on the <code>gem</code> command and the RubyGems client! Exactly as we’ve hoped since the beginning, more members means we have the budget for more developer time. The RubyGems library ships inside Ruby itself, and is used extensively by Bundler, and could really use some maintenance. Check back here next month for an update on our progress finding someone to tackle RubyGems.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>

    <p>From September 19 to October 18, Ruby Together took in $16,315. In total, we spent $15,830. Here’s a breakdown of where that money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$73.56 in dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$499.09 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$877.69 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>
      <li>$400 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$4,735.43 on community outreach including stickers, conferences, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you may have noticed, we’ve started spending a bit more on community outreach. It seems to be working! The Ruby community has been very encouraging and enthusiastic, and so we’re going to keep doing everything we can to let everyone know that we exist.</p>

    <p>In the upcoming month, both André and Carina will be working on outreach and evangelism projects. If we can find the right developers, we’ll also start paying for work on the RubyGems client library and gem command, following our roadmap.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the support, everyone!<br />
    We couldn’t do it without you. &lt;3</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />
    André and the Ruby Together team</p>

    <p>Just in time for Halloween, it’s the Ruby Together monthly update for October 2015! This month we paid for 40 hours of developer time to maintain and improve Bundler and RubyGems.org. We gained four new individual members, and three new company members. Every new member means we’re able to do more for the Ruby community, so if you’re not a member yet, <a href="https://rubytogether.org/#join">sign up today!</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">Ruby Together news</h2>

    <p>In the last month, André spoke at ROSSConf, the <a href="http://rossconf.io">Ruby Open Source Software Conference</a>, in Berlin, where he spoke about the history of Bundler and led a hackday of work on Bundler by new contributors. André also attended EuRuKo, the European Ruby Conference, and gave a lightning talk about Ruby Together.</p>

    <p>Attendees at both conferences were very positive and excited about the idea of Ruby Together, but most of them were hearing about Ruby Together for the first time. Since it seems like most Ruby developers and companies haven’t heard about Ruby Together yet, we’re going to work on doing more conferences and outreach in the coming months.</p>

    <p>Since the last update, we’ve had three new companies join: <a href="http://contribsys.com">Contributed Systems</a> (makers of the popular <a href="http://sidekiq.org">Sidekiq</a> gem), <a href="http://estately.com">Estately</a>, and <a href="http://devmynd.com">DevMynd</a>. We’ve had four new individual members join: Dave H, Sudodoki, Rebecca Skinner, and Raphael Campardou. Thanks for your support, everyone!</p>

    <p>With those new members, our projected monthly income is now $13,100 per month. With that income, we’ll be able to not only pay for maintenance work on Bundler and RubyGems.org, but also pay for outreach and evangelism work to let more companies know about what we’re doing. With more companies, we’ll be able to support more Ruby open source projects and get things done even faster. Hooray!</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">Bundler news</h2>

    <p>Excluding merge commits, this month the Bundler repository saw 136 commits by 17 authors. 28 pull requests were merged, and a good amount of progress was made on bug fixes, new features, and future plans.</p>

    <p>The most significant progress was on the new <a href="https://github.com/bundler/gemstash">gemstash</a> project, an open source server for hosting gems. Gemstash is able to act as a caching proxy for RubyGems.org, providing local copies of gems for a data center or office. It is also able to host private or internal gems, and offers an easy way for teams to migrate away from using gems directly out of git repositories. We’re not quite at 1.0, but everything is already working! We’ll have a release candidate out shortly once we’ve polished up the documentation and done a bit more QA testing.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">RubyGems.org news</h2>

    <p>On RubyGems.org and associated repositories, 23 pull requests were merged, and in total 20 authors pushed 114 commits.</p>

    <p>The SSL certificate for status.rubygems.org was renewed and updated, and the <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/adoption-center">gem adoption center project</a> continues to make progress after the end of the RailsGirls Summer of Code.</p>

    <p>We also applied many security updates, continued work on the integration with Fastly, and shipped a beta version of the completely rewritten new-and-improved search. Once we’re sure that it works, we’ll enable it for everyone, and searching for gems will finally include all of their information rather than just their names.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>

    <p>From September 19 to October 18, Ruby Together took in $12,680. In total, we spent $11.245.53. Here’s a breakdown of where that money went:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$75.43 in dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$403.72 on payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$1804.79 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>
      <li>$1072.50 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$3,396.61 on community outreach including stickers, conferences, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Feedback from the community about Ruby Together indicates that it is relatively unknown. As a result, we’re planing to do more outreach and evangelism work in the coming months, including hiring professional help. In the meantime, if you have friends, coworkers, or managers who don’t know about Ruby Together yet, let them know!</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />
    André and the Ruby Together team</p>

    <p>Hello, and welcome to the Ruby Together monthly update for September! This month we were joined by 4 developers and 4 companies. We continued to maintain and develop Bundler and RubyGems.org, paying for 58 hours of developer time. Keep reading for the rest of the details on our new members, our work, and our finances this month.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">Ruby Together News</h2>

    <p>On September 9, André went on the <a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/">Ruby Rogues podcast</a> for <a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/224-rr-ruby-together-with-andr-arko">an episode about Ruby Together</a> with rogues Charles Max Wood and Coraline Ada Ehkme. They discussed why Ruby Together was founded, what its goals are, and why being a non-profit is so important, as well as answering a bunch of common questions about Ruby Together. There’s both an audio recording of the episode and a text transcript, so if you’re interested in what exactly Ruby Together does and how it all works, check it out.</p>

    <p>This week, André will be in Berlin, attending the <a href="">RailsGirls Summer of Code</a> wrap-up party and speaking at <a href="http://www.rossconf.io/event/berlin/">ROSSConf</a> about how Bundler works. He will also be in Salzburg, Austria for <a href="http://www.euruko2015.org">EuRuKo</a> on October 17 &amp; 18, with lots of stickers. Come say hello and get some stickers if you’ll be around!</p>

    <p>Our four new members this month include Rene Sanchez, Ivar Vong, and Kieth Pitty. We were also joined by four new companies: Emerald members <a href="http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a> and <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a>, and Topaz members <a href="https://squareup.com">Square</a>, and <a href="http://intercom.io">Intercom</a>. With these new members, our projected monthly income is now $12,190.00.</p>

    <p>This infographic, taken from our roadmap, shows where we’re at right now and what we’ll be able to do as more members join.</p>

    <div class="clear"><img alt="$12,190.00 per month" src="/email/2015-09-23-september-2015-monthly-update/roadmap-status.png" width="520" /></div>

    <p>Thanks for supporting our work, everyone!</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">Bundler News</h2>

    <p>This month, the Bundler team merged 23 pull requests, including 218 new commits from 14 different authors. We fixed bugs, improved error messages, and added features to the in-progress 1.11 and 2.0 releases.</p>

    <p>Integration work on the new index format is almost complete: it works! We just have to handle yanked gems, and it will be time to start beta-testing. It’s very exciting to see the culmination of two years of planning and work pay off.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">RubyGems.org News</h2>

    <p>The RubyGems.org team kept things moving smoothly this month, merging 16 pull requests, including 95 commits from 14 authors. We fixed bugs, added tests, applied security updates, and handled unexpected traffic spikes.</p>

    <p>We also kept working on the new logging system, merged a Chinese (Simplified) translation for the RubyGems.org interface, moved even more of the site to be served by Fastly, and renewed our SSL certificate for another year.</p>

    <p>The RailsGirls Summer of Code ends this week, and so we are working with the RGSoC team to deploy their work in a Gem Adoption Center that will allow unmaintaned gems to be adopted by new owners.</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>

    <p>This month one company pre-paid for an entire year, and Ruby Together took in $22,043.83 over the last month.</p>

    <p>In total, we spent $16,120.54. Here’s a breakdown of our spending by category:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$5,700 for 38 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$76.20 in dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$444.51 in payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$1,957.97 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>
      <li>$1,600 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$3,341.86 on community outreach including stickers, conferences, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Like we predicted last month, professional services have dropped dramatically, while we’ve started spending more on conferences and other community outreach. Help us get the word out!</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />
    André and the Ruby Together team</p>

    <p>Hello, and welcome to the Ruby Together update for August! This month 5 developers and 3 companies joined, including <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">David Heinemier Hansson</a> (creator of Rails) and his company <a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>. We also continued to maintain and develop Bundler and RubyGems.org, paying for 40 hours of developer time. Keep reading for more details on projects, members, and finances.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">Ruby Together news</h2>

    <p>Since the last update, five people joined as new members, including Jacob Helwig, James Turnbull, and Matt Mills. <a href="https://kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> joined as a Topaz member, and two companies joined as Emerald members: <a href="https://yammer.com">Yammer</a> and <a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>.</p>

    <p>I’m excited to announce that thanks to our new members this month, we’ve hit our first major fundraising goal! With an projected monthly income of $10,780.00, Ruby Together is now able sustainably pay for ongoing work on both Bundler and RubyGems.org every week.</p>

    <p>This infographic, taken from <a href="https://rubytogether.org/roadmap">our roadmap</a> shows where we’re at right now, and what we’ll be able to do as more members join.</p>

    <div class="clear"><img alt="$10,780.00 per month" src="/email/2015-08-18-august-2015-monthly-update/roadmap-status.png" width="520" /></div>

    <p>Today, <a href="http://github.com/rubygems">RubyGems</a> doesn’t have any consistently active maintainers, but it has outstanding issues that we would really like to start working on. As more companies and developers join, we plan to fund work on RubyGems as quickly as possible.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">Bundler news</h2>

    <p>On the Bundler team, we’re just now wrapping up the Google Summer of Code and the four (!) students who had projects working on Bundler. <a href="http://github.com/suhastech">@suhastech</a> researched plugin systems and wrote a prototype that we will use to inform future plugins work. <a href="http://github.com/rgb-one">@rgb-one</a> fielded tickets and refactored and improved the Bundler website. <a href="http://github.com/smlance">@smlance</a> worked on changes for Bundler 2.0, which we hope to release as an alpha within a few weeks. <a href="http://github.com/fotanus">@fotanus</a>’ worked on the new index server, which should be live soon.</p>

    <p>Complementing @fotanus’ work on the new index server, core team member <a href="http://github.com/segiddins">@segiddins</a> is finishing up the new index client, and we plan to release the fruit of their labor as Bundler 1.11 very soon.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">RubyGems.org news</h2>

    <p>On the RubyGems.org side, we made steady progress on the switchover to using <a href="https://fastly.com">Fastly</a> as our CDN. Last month, about 45% of our total data transfer was served by Fastly while this month it should be closer to 90%. The RubyGems.org servers were upgraded to use Ruby 2.2.2, for the latest performance and security improvements.</p>

    <p>We also added publicly accessible backups of our Redis server, hardened the site against failing services, applied security patches, upgraded gems, updated packages, reviewed pull requests, and answered support tickets. It was a busy month!</p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>

    <p>Thanks to one company pre-paying for over 9 months, Ruby Together took in $19,239.00 over the last month.</p>

    <p>Thanks to that extra money, we were able to repay a loan that covered our initial startup costs. We also bought some software and hardware that will help us do our jobs more easily.</p>

    <p>In total, we spent $16,033.77. Here’s a breakdown of our spending by category:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$74.63 in dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$611.98 in payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$4,438.16 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>
      <li>$2,185 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
      <li>$2,205 to finish repaying company-founding expenses, including legal counsel and government fees</li>
      <li>$549 on community outreach including stickers, conferences, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As predicted, our spending on professional services has gone down now that we’re a bit more established as a company. In the coming months, we expect to start spending more on community outreach and conferences.</p>

    <p>Right now, the most common response when we approach developers and companies is simply “what’s Ruby Together? I haven’t heard about it”. That needs to change. :)</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />

    <p>Hello, and welcome to the Ruby Together update for July! This double update includes both June and July, so it’s longer than usual. We’ve also started including details about Ruby Together’s budget and development spending in our monthly updates, so be sure to take a look.</p>

    <h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

    <p>In June &amp; July, we launched a new website, a significant new version of Bundler, shipped new ops tools for RubyGems.org, gained 15 new members, and paid for 80.33 hours of maintenance and development work on Ruby infrastructure. If you’re interested in the details, keep going!</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">Ruby Together news</h2>

    <p>The <a href="https://rubytogether.org">Ruby Together website</a> relaunched just this week. The new design is a direct result of feedback from the community, and focuses on keeping the community informed about what we’re doing and what our plans are. The <a href="https://rubytogether.org/roadmap">Ruby Together roadmap</a> showcases those plans, while the new <a href="https://rubytogether.org/companies#faq">faq</a> answers your questions.</p>

    <p>Founding board member <a href="http://twitter.com/tenderlove">Aaron Patterson</a> informed us that while he is still “on board” with Ruby Together, he needed to retire from our board of directors. Instead of leaving his seat empty, the board conducted a search, and we have appointed <a href="http://twitter.com/coralineada">Coraline Ada Ehmke</a> as an interim board member. Best wishes to Aaron, who will now have more time to spend with his cats, and welcome to Coraline!</p>

    <p>Finally, as the culmination of weeks of planning, we were able to announce that Ruby Together will only fund development work on open source projects that adhere to a code of conduct for maintainers and contributors. Anyone interested can check our blog for the <a href="https://rubytogether.org/news/2015-07-15-project-codes-of-conduct">more detailed announcement</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">Bundler news</h2>

    <p>Bundler 1.10 includes several long-awaited features: a <code>lock</code> command, inline Gemfiles inside of scripts, the ability to disable post-install messages, optional gem groups, and conditional gem groups. For much more detail, including a discussion of the BUNDLED WITH section in the lock file, check out <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2015/06/24/version-1-10-released.html">the 1.10 release announcement</a>.</p>

    <p>A combination of unexpected factors made some users very unhappy with the 1.10 release. As a result, we spent dozens of hours talking with users, coming up with workarounds, and trying to help everyone upgrade to the newest version of Bundler as smoothly as possible. An overview of the problems and the results of that work are also discussed in the release announcement, so reading it is probably worth your time.</p>

    <p>Since the last update, <a href="https://www.google-melange.com">Google Summer of Code</a> kicked off, bringing four student contributors to Bundler! For three months, <a href="https://github.com/smlance">@smlance</a> will be working on Bundler 2.0, <a href="https://github.com/fotanus">@fotanus</a> will be working on the new index format, <a href="https://github.com/rgb-one">@rgb-one</a> will be working on project maintenance and the website, and <a href="https://github.com/suhastech">@suhastech</a> be working on a plugin system for Bundler. We’re very excited to have them!</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">RubyGems.org news</h2>

    <p>The RubyGems.org team, led by David Radcliffe, made some great progress this month. Deploying the site is now handled by <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shipit-engine">Shipit</a>. The logging system that’s been in progress got some attention, and we’ll be migrating to a new service in July that should need much less maintenance in the future. We switched to using a new chatbot, improved our Fastly config to reduce client errors and position us for the full Fastly migration, and started work on improved search. Finally, two new ops members joined the volunteer team, bringing the ops team up to 4 members.</p>

    <p><a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org">RailsGirls Summer of Code</a> also started, with a team working on RubyGems.org. RailsGirls Team Binary will be working on a RubyGems adoption center, to match up gems that need maintainers with developers who have time to work on them.</p>

    <h2 id="new-members">New members</h2>

    <p>In June &amp; July, 9 new developer members joined, including Phil Cohen, Brian Lauber, Camille Baldock, Joshua Bell, Rohit Paul Kurukilla, and Nick &amp; Amanda Quaranto.</p>

    <p>Four new companies joined: Ecstatic Labs, Optoro, CustomInk, and Koombea.</p>

    <p>Today, Ruby Together has 75 developer members, 4 Topaz company members, 3 Emerald company members, and 1 Sapphire company member.</p>

    <h2 id="funding-status">Funding status</h2>

    <p>Our combined memberships currently amount to a projected monthly income of $8,350 per month. This infographic, taken from <a href="https://rubytogether.org/roadmap">our roadmap</a> shows where we’re at right now, and what we’ll be able to do as more members join.</p>

    <p><img src="/email/2015-07-18-july-2015-monthly-update/roadmap-status.png" alt="$8,350.00 per month" /></p>

    <h2 id="budget--expenses">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>

    <p>During the months of June and July, Ruby Together took in $20,811.92 and spent $20,031.92. Here’s a breakdown of the categories that we spent money in:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$4,550 for 30.33 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$7,500 for 50 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>
      <li>$148.92 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>
      <li>$613.58 in payment processing fees</li>
      <li>$3,121.92 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, taxes, etc.</li>
      <li>$4,877.50 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Spending on professional services is high right now, because the company is still getting off the ground in our third and fourth months of existence. As our revenue grows, we expect to spend more on developer time and servers, and the same amount or less on professional services and overhead.</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />
    André and the Ruby Together team</p>

    <p>At Ruby Together, we are very proud of the culture that has emerged around the Ruby programming language. However, we also acknowledge that our community still has progress to make with regard to being welcoming and accepting of different kinds of contributors, be they women, people of color, people on the LGBT spectrum, or other underrepresented populations.</p>

    <p>One of the ways to signal that an open source community is welcoming is to adopt a formal code of conduct. Codes of conduct, which started primarily as a means of improving conferences and other events, have gained traction over the past year with open source projects as well. The <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org">Contributor Covenant</a> is one of the most popular of these codes of conduct, and has been adopted by dozens of open source projects including Bundler, GitLab, AngularJS, rubygems.org, and RubyBench.</p>

    <p>Being overt in our openness is a first step toward making the Ruby community a better place. It is in this spirit that Ruby Together is announcing a new policy regarding open source Ruby projects that we will support: to be eligible, a project must have a clear and enforceable code of conduct that applies to all contributors and maintainers, and project owners must make a commitment to ensuring that the policies laid out by that code of conduct are enforced.</p>

    <p>We as a community have created something special, and it’s our responsibility to ensure that our core values are clearly communicated and shared by everyone. We hope that only supporting projects with a code of conduct is a positive step toward this goal.</p>

    <p>Wow. June was really busy. Right as it was time for us to write the June update, the Bundler 1.10 release turned into a Bundler 1.10 fiasco. We spent dozens of hours talking with users, coming up with workarounds, and trying to help everyone upgrade to the newest version of Bundler as smoothly as possible.</p>

    <p>The discussions and workarounds are summarized in the epic <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2015/06/24/version-1-10-released.html">Bundler 1.10 release announcement and retrospective</a>. We weren’t able to complete the regular Ruby Together update due to that emergency work, but we’ll have a complete update ready on schedule for July, and it will include details about June as well. See you then!</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the second Ruby Together monthly update, for May 2015.</p>

    <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

    <p>This month, Ruby Together was able to fund 20 hours of maintenance and development work on Bundler, and 20 hours of maintenance and development work on RubyGems.org, as well as the hosting costs for RubyBench.org.</p>

    <p>As more members join Ruby Together, we’ll be able to fund more development work and complete more useful and exciting plans. In the next few weeks, we’ll be revealing more details about those plans and how members can help us get them done.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-work-log">Bundler work log</h2>

    <p>Since last month, Bundler released a lot of new versions: 1.7.15, 1.9.5, 1.9.6, 1.9.7, 1.9.8, 1.9.9, 1.10.0.pre.1, 1.10.0.pre.2, 1.10.0.pre.2, and 1.10.0.rc.</p>

    <p>The 1.9.5-1.9.9 releases fixed various bugs in the 1.9 series as they were found. Happily, none of those minor bugs were the result of the new resolver, making Molinillo a resounding success.</p>

    <p>The big news this month is that version 1.10 has reached Release Candidate! This version includes a boatload of new features: optional groups, conditional gem installation, inline gemspecs for scripts, the lock command, dramatically improved outdated output, a 10x speedup while resolving slow Gemfiles, and more.</p>

    <p>Read more about the exact changes in <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/1-10-stable/CHANGELOG.md">the changelog</a>, install the RC by running <code>gem install bundler --pre</code>, and try it out!</p>

    <p>We also worked on changes that will become part of version 1.11, writing code that allows Bundler to understand the long-planned new index format. Once it’s done, running <code>bundle install</code> will be way faster, no matter where you are in the world.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-work-log">RubyGems.org work log</h2>

    <p>RubyGems.org maintenance this month included security upgrades, gem upgrades, ongoing work on the logging system, and starting an upgrade of the deploy system.</p>

    <p>Development work included several small fixes and upgrades, and the large change of deleting yanked gems immediately when they are yanked. All previously-yanked gems have now been deleted, and all of the RubyGems.org help tickets about deleting yanked gems have been resolved.</p>

    <h2 id="meet-the-team">Meet the team!</h2>

    <p>In the next month, André will be speaking at <a href="http://www.reddotrubyconf.com">RedDotRubyConf</a> in Singapore, <a href="http://www.rubynation.org">RubyNation</a> in Washington DC, and <a href="http://magmaconf.com">MagmaConf</a> in Manzanillo, Mexico. If you see him, be sure to say hello and ask for a Ruby Together sticker!</p>

    <h2 id="coming-up">Coming up…</h2>

    <p>During the month of June, the RubyGems.org team will be working on upgrading the deploy system and the centralized logging service.</p>

    <p>The Bundler team will be squashing bugs and writing documentation to finish the 1.10 release, as well as continuing work on version 1.11. Faster <code>bundle install</code>, here we come!</p>

    <h2 id="new-members">New members</h2>

    <p>In the last month, 11 individual members joined Ruby Together, including Yang Bo, Paul Campbell, Serene Careaga, and Janis Miezitis.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the support, everyone!</p>

    <p>If your company hasn’t joined Ruby Together yet, let them know about it! Ruby Together is both <a href="https://rubytogether.org/companies">good and good for companies</a>, and we’ll be able to do more for the community as more companies join us.</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />

    <p>Hello, everyone! This is the Ruby Together monthly update for April, 2015. This was our first month in operation, and we were able to make a huge amount of progress this month.</p>

    <h2 id="new-hires">New hires</h2>

    <p>This month, Ruby Together hired André Arko (that’s me!) to work on Bundler, which led to the release of several significant new features, detailed in the “New releases” section below.</p>

    <p>We also hired David Radcliffe, starting to pay him for his work on the RubyGems.org servers and infrastructure. David has worked tirelessly for years to ensure that RubyGems.org stays up to serve gems to the world. As a volunteer, David has spent countless nights and weekends donating his time and expertise to the Ruby community, and he richly deserves to be paid a fair rate for his work that benefits every person and company using Ruby.</p>

    <h2 id="new-projects">New projects</h2>

    <p>As planned, Ruby Together hired André Arko to continue ongoing maintenance and feature work on Bundler.</p>

    <p>Next, shortly after our public launch, we were able to form <a href="https://rubytogether.org/rubygems">The RubyGems Partnership</a> together with <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a>. As part of that partnership, we have hired <a href="http://github.com/dwradcliffe">David Radcliffe</a> to support his ongoing maintenance and development work on RubyGems.org.</p>

    <p>In addition to Bundler and RubyGems, we were able to start supporting the RubyBench.org project by funding the dedicated server that the benchmark suite runs on. Since RubyBench is a benchmarking project, it is vital that the test suite run on its own hardware, and that the hardware always be exactly the same. In the future, we plan to support active development of RubyBench as a valuable community resource.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-work-log">Bundler work log</h2>

    <p>The last month included a record number of Bundler releases: we released versions 1.7.14, 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.0, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, and 1.9.4.</p>

    <p>The 1.7.14 fix addressed a couple of small bugs and one regression, and we have since wound down ongoing support work for the 1.7.x release branch.</p>

    <p>The 1.8.6 and 1.8.7 releases fixed edge cases when installing multiple compiled gems in parallel, updating only the requested gem when multiple gems came from a specific gem server, and fixed a regression that could suppress errors that occurred while Bundler required a gem.</p>

    <p>The big news, though, was the 1.9 release! Bundler 1.9 is the first version to feature the shiny new dependency resolver Molinillo, written by CocoaPods team member Samuel Giddins. For three months, Ruby Together member Stripe sponsored Samuel to develop a dependency resolver from scratch in Ruby.</p>

    <p>That project was a rousing success, and the resulting resolver has now shipped in both CocoaPods and Bundler. It’s even been <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1189">submitted to RubyGems as a pull request</a>. As a result of this cooperation between all three Ruby projects that manage dependencies, any improvements or bugfixes to the dependency resolver in one of the projects can be shared among all of them. You can <a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2015/03/21/hello-bundler-19.html">read more about the 1.9 release</a> on the Bundler blog.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-work-log">RubyGems.org work log</h2>

    <p>RubyGems.org maintenance this month included several security upgrades, including an upgrade to Ruby version 2.1.6. We also started work on a centralized logging service for all the systems that keep RubyGems.org running, which will be a big help when work needs to be done in the future.</p>

    <p>Development work included several small fixes and upgrades, while the primary focus was on designing and implementing an upcoming policy change: soon, yanked gems will be deleted rather than simply removed from the main gem index. This change should significantly reduce the number of support tickets that the RubyGems.org team has to answer, and make the entire yanking process act the way that users expect it to.</p>

    <h2 id="meet-the-team">Meet the team!</h2>

    <p>This upcoming week, André, David, and several Ruby Together board members will all be attending RailsConf 2015 in Atlanta, GA. As well as attending, André will be giving a talk titled “How Does Bundler Work, Anyway?” on Tuesday, April 21 at 11am in room 204 CDE.</p>

    <p>If you’ll be at the conference, say hello to us—we’ll have Ruby Together stickers for you!</p>

    <h2 id="coming-up">Coming up…</h2>

    <p>During May, the Bundler team will be working on finishing the 1.10 and 1.11 releases, which will include several useful new features and a major optimization to how long it takes to run <code>bundle install</code>. Keep an eye out for more about those changes in next month’s newsletter.</p>

    <p>The RubyGems.org team will be working to finish the consolidated logging changes that were started in April, and starting work on revamping the worldwide gem mirrors to use the same automation infrastructure that was just finished for the main site. They’ll also be working on implementing the server-side changes that are required for Bundler 1.10 and 1.11.</p>

    <h2 id="new-members">New members</h2>

    <p>In the last month, Stripe and Engine Yard joined Ruby Together as founding corporate members. Cloud City Development and Bleacher Report also joined as corporate members.</p>

  content_cache: "\n<h2 id=\"five-things-to-be-grateful-for-in-the-ruby-together-community\">Five
    Things To Be Grateful For in the Ruby Together Community</h2>\n\n<p>It’s hard
    to believe that December is here. Even more mind-boggling: in the next few weeks
    we’ll be winding down a decade. This was a tough year. We want to commend and
    thank all of the developers who helped us maintain healthy projects and a kind
    community in a year where no connection or offer of support was taken for granted.</p>\n\n<p>It
    might be easy for any of us to list all the ways this year seemed to limit us.
    We’d love to offer you a moment to reflect with us on what we’re grateful for
    in the Ruby Together community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Five years of Ruby Together!</strong></p>\n\n<p>We
    can’t let the end of this year pass without acknowledging our five year anniversary!
    In 2015 Ruby Together incorporated as a solution to the dire need for\nconsistent
    contributors to Ruby projects that provide infrastructure for the entire community;
    in particular Bundler, RubyGems and RubyGems.org. Five years and a \npandemic
    later… and we’re still being supported by our community. We can’t thank you enough
    for demonstrating how valuable and worthwhile funding this work is to you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.
    A Source of stability this year</strong></p>\n\n<p>We really want to brag about
    our uptime. Before Ruby Together, with Bundler and Ruby Gems run entirely by just
    a couple of extremely part-time volunteers, outages could last a day and even
    — on a few occasions — multiple days in a row. In fact, a week-long outage due
    to a security issue directly led to the founding of Ruby Together.</p>\n\n<p>All
    of Ruby Together’s work has been worth it: as of December 8, we have managed 99.997%
    uptime in 2020 — less than 15 minutes of downtime during the entire year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.
    Features that make us feel festive</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since Ruby Together launched
    in 2015, we’ve reached some huge milestones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>there are now
    over 175,000 gems (up from 101,000)</li>\n  <li>there are over 1,216,000 versions
    of gems (up from 583,000)</li>\n  <li>we have served 64 billion (!) gem downloads
    (up from 4.5 billion in 2015)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One of the accomplishments we’re
    most proud of is designing and shipping the compact index that keeps track of
    every gem and dependency. It’s been the key to faster installs and updates, as
    well as ensuring that developers get gem versions that will work with their version
    of Ruby.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, we migrated all of RubyGems.org to use the
    Fastly content delivery network, dramatically increasing the speed of downloading
    gems around the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Maintenance, money…and maids</strong></p>\n\n<p>A
    few reasons to be grateful according to our team members — especially if you use
    Ruby every day:</p>\n\n<p>“[Ruby Together] ensures that chores of keeping shared
    infrastructure up and running is well compensated and the burden of maintaining
    a shared project doesn’t fall on a single contributor or a company.”</p>\n\n<p>“[Ruby
    Together] seems more like the housemaid of Ruby community to me. It does the work
    we all agree we need to do but no one wants to do it themselves.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.
    Our incredible developer community</strong></p>\n\n<p>We’re lucky that developers
    we’ve connected with in the Ruby Together community are welcoming and inclusive,
    and we actively work to keep it that way. We have a commitment to only fund projects
    with a code of conduct. The most popular code of conduct in the Ruby community,
    the <a href=\"https://www.contributor-covenant.org/\">Contributor Covenant</a>,
    was created by Ruby Together board member <a href=\"https://github.com/coralineada\">Coraline
    Ada Ehmke</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We’re cautiously optimistic about what the next year
    holds. For now, we’re thankful to be able to continue this work and to be a part
    of your community.</p>\n\n<p>(<strong>Extra thanks:</strong> Of course, we can’t
    let the end of this decade pass without acknowledging 25 years of Ruby  programming
    language. We’re grateful to Yukihiro Matsumoto and the early developers who help
    make the language what it is today. The world of open source has transformed in
    massive ways since then. One thing that hasn’t changed: open source is valuable
    and open source developers deserve to be compensated for their work.)</p>\n\n\n"

    3.2. \U0001F389 On the Bundler side, this minor release provides some major enhancements
    in how Bundler treats platforms, and also a few extra features. Check out <a href=\"https://bundler.io/blog/2020/12/09/bundler-v2-2.html\">the
    Bundler 2.2 release blog post</a> for details. On the RubyGems side, the release
    provides several bug fixes, a noticeable boot time speed-up, better integration
    in ruby-core and alternative implementations, and adds support for a change in
    the server side that allows using scoped API keys.</p>\n\n<p>After the releases,
    we also received the corresponding feedback and regression reports, and addressed
    almost everything reported through 4 patch level releases of each library. In

    We also investigated and removed <code>ruby-bitcoin</code> and <code>pretty_color</code>
    gems for  containing malicious code which could steal sensitive information; this
    issue was reported by <a href=\"https://github.com/mensfeld\">@mensfeld</a> for

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During June, our work was supported by <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>, <a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>In June, Ruby Together was supported by 74 different companies. Two new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together. In total, we were supported by 82 individual members and 66 friends of Ruby Together.</p>

    <p>Developer evangelist <a href="http://twitter.com/aspleenic">PJ Hagerty</a> visited a number of conferences and meetups in June, including BostonRB, Texas Linux Fest, and RubyConf Kenya.</p>

    <p>As promised, we also published the results from our <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/board/blob/master/meetings/2018-06-23.md">June 23 board meeting</a>. We made some great progress, and expect to be able to announce the new projects that we’re working on within the next month or two.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>Last month, we fixed some bugs and our Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students finished work on the <code>bundle remove</code> feature. We also created a <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/6582">checklist for the Bundler 2 release</a>, and finished documentation for the <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/5252">Bundler release process</a>.</p>

    <p>After that, we published a <a href="https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/pull/12">public request for comments on the idea of Bundler release channels</a>. Just this week, we <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6524">learned a lot about how Docker and Bundler can work better together</a>.</p>

    <p>This month, Bundler gained 63 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 738 additions and 102 deletions across 48 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>In June, we updated over 25 dependencies, including nokogiri and the sprockets security release, and updated to Rails 5.1. We also fixed a longstanding and frustrating issue where multiple CI builds pushing a new gem version at the same time could result in a checksum error when trying to install the new version.  On June 27, we deprecated the “gem edit” page and it will be removed altogether on July 10.</p>

    <p>Instead of editing gem metadata at rubygems.org, we recommend using the gem specification itself. Use <code>Gem::Specification#metadata</code> to setting links to a gem’s homepage, changelog, documentation, and other websites. This will help us reduce the complexity of rubygems.org by making <code>Gem::Specification#metadata</code> the single source of truth and it will also allow gem owners to set different URLs by version.</p>

    <p>This month, rubygems.org saw 28 commits making 159 additions and 74 deletions across 29 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems saw a lot of activity this month, with 29 merged pull requests. Changes included some support for the upcoming Ruby 2.7, test improvements, a fix for a leaking tempfile, better support for frozen string literals, and better support for case-insensitive file systems. We also added more deprecations for the upcoming 3.0 release, improved the way RubyGems interacts with Bundler 1.16.2 and the upcoming 2.0, and fixed some edge cases with stub gem specifications.  We shipped most those changes by releasing RubyGems 2.7.7 on June 8.</p>

    <p>After releasing 2.7.7, we merged several fixes for installing gems directly from an AWS S3 bucket source, improved some warning messages, and fixed issues activating gems when the same gem is installed for more than one platform at once.</p>

    <p>In total, RubyGems gained 67 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 439 additions and 62 deletions across 24 files.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash saw a bug fix for health check race conditions last month. It gained 2 new commits, contributed by 2 authors. There were 11 additions and 3 deletions across 2 files.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-toolbox">ruby toolbox</h2>

    <p>Hey everyone!</p>

    <p>This month, I prepared the request-for-feedback PR for metric rankings I mentioned in the last update. If you have a minute, please <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/233">leave your suggestions in this PR</a>. Additionally, there was some maintenance work, including gem updates and inbound catalog change reviews.</p>

    <p>While the metric rankings are open for discussion in the PR, I want to set up automated database dumps available to download from the site in July.
    (<a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues/73">Refer to this issue</a> for more information.) This will serve two purposes: it makes it easier to get a reasonable local dataset for development, and it allows people
    interested in crunching some numbers easier access to the Toolbox dataset. I’d also <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues/109">like to do some improvements to the search</a> that didn’t make it into the site for the original re-launch.</p>

    <p>As always, your feedback is very welcome. If you have any suggestions or thoughts you’d like to share you can do so via <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues">GitHub issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>

    <p>Thank you also to everyone who contributed pull requests in June: ch4mpignator, cvshepherd, danielwestendorf, enkessler, piotrmurach, samnissen, and splashinn</p>

    <p>Best,
    Christoph</p>

    <h2 id="budget-amp-expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>In June, we saw $15,465.00 in total income, and spent a total of $13,490.43.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$1,722.50 for 11.5 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>

    two-factor authentication to RubyGems.org, and continued to implement gem security
    advisories.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bundler-news\">bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>In May, Bundler
    saw some bug fixes, a <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/commit/9e87a1ca4b0c3002ac2774e4837234cef7e3ce08\">new

    toolbox news</h2>\n\n<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n\n<p>Like April, May turned out pretty
    busy for me so I had very limited time to spend on the Toolbox, but I did get
    around to doing some work on the global metrics rankings that I had written about
    in the previous updates. I’m currently trying to figure out how to display them
    best in an \neasy-to-understand manner—for example, gem download counts are distributed
    pretty unevenly, with the top 1% gems by downloads count being the reason for
    ~87% of all gem downloads—so it’s a bit tricky to display a fair and meaningful
    ranking for “all the other” projects. I expect to have a work-in-progress pull
    request on this available in the next week or two, so please keep an eye on <a
    href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pulls\">Ruby Toolbox’s PRs</a>

    companies, including Sapphire member <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>.
    6 companies joined as new members, including <a href=\"http://www.pieceofcode.com\">Piece

    to bring back the Ruby umbrella organization for Summer of Code projects improving
    not just implementations of Ruby, but any Ruby open source project. Our efforts
    were more successful than we expected, and more than 50 students submitted project
    applications! We were able to accept six of those students. We are very excited
    to be hosting Shlok Srivastava, Qio Chaofan, Nicholas Yang, Yimin Zhao, Agrim
    Mittal, and Yogesh Kataria this summer, as they work on RubyGems, MRI, Bundler,
    and RDoc. Check back for progress updates next month!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"railsconf\">railsconf</h3>\n\n<p>Board

    gave a talk on “Scaling the Software Artisan” and André gave a talk titled “Pairing:
    a guide to fruitful collaboration \U0001F353\U0001F351\U0001F350”. Adarsh and
    Valerie arranged a scheduled session for in-person community feedback, and brought
    that feedback back to the board.</p>\n\n<p>At RailsConf we also distributed stickers

    post-RailsConf news, the board met with Ruby developer Sam Phippen to discuss
    his concerns about Ruby Together’s governance model. As a result of that conversation,
    we held a board meeting and created a new forum for communication between the
    community and the board. <a href=\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2018-04-25-april-22-board-meeting-results\">We

    id=\"ruby-toolbox-news\">ruby toolbox news</h2>\n\n<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n\n<p>Due
    to a whole bunch of other obligations, April turned out to be a rather slow month;
    apart from some very minor maintenance work, I sadly did not find any time to
    spend meaningful work on the Ruby Toolbox. That being said, May looks a bit more
    promising. Rolling over my plans from the last monthly update for March, I want
    to focus mostly on making it easier to see at a glance how a projects given metric
    relates to the greater ecosystem - so for example in what percentile the number
    of downloads is in relation to other projects.</p>\n\n<p>As always, your feedback
    is very welcome, if you have any suggestions or thoughts you’d like to share you

    <h2 id="april-22-board-meeting-results">april 22 board meeting results</h2>

    <h3 id="attendees-and-agenda">Attendees and agenda</h3>

    <p>The <a href="https://rubytogether.org/team">full board</a> was present, including André Arko, Coraline Ada Ehmke, Valerie Woolard Srinivasen, Allison Sheren McMillan, Courteney Ervin, and Adarsh Pandit. Topics included increasing communication with the community, increasing transparency about how projects are funded, and the board’s position on funded project governance.</p>

    <h3 id="decisions">Decisions</h3>

    <p>To increase communication and transparency about board conversations and decisions, we have created <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/board">a GitHub repository for the Ruby Together Board of Directors</a>. The repo will include planned agendas for future board meetings, summaries of meetings after they happen, and instructions on how to provide feedback to the board. The same information will also be published via Slack, Twitter, email, and any other Ruby Together communication channels.</p>

    <p>To provide clearer and more detailed information about how Ruby Together’s finances work, we will create a guide to understanding Ruby Together budget reports. As a board, we recognize that there has been confusion about how the budget is allocated and spent. To resolve this, we plan to provide additional detail about where money is spent and why it is spent on those things, supplementing the <a href="https://rubytogether.org/news/">public monthly progress and budget reports</a>.</p>

    <p>In a thoughtful discussion, we re-examined our existing requirements for funded project governance. Ultimately, we decided to retain the requirement that funded projects adopt and enforce a code of conduct. We also decided to actively avoid any other governance requirements. Funded projects are free to organize themselves and make decisions in any way the project contributors and maintainers work out amongst themselves.</p>

    <h3 id="future-plans">Future plans</h3>

    <p>We recognize that there are improvements that can be made, and we plan to continue to work on additional topics in the near future. The topics we plan to investigate in the future include (but are not limited to) finalizing our <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/feedback/blob/main/VISION_MISSON_VALUES.md">mission and values statement</a>, improving the project funding process, exploring additional funding options, evaluating compensation rates for paid work, and adding a mentorship component to work for Ruby Together. We also plan to spend time on contingency and succession planning, setting up Ruby Together to have a long and stable life ahead of it. We don’t yet know what the results of those investigations will be, but we plan to keep you posted about future decisions and actions.</p>

    <p>We understand and acknowledge the concerns that people have around conflicts of interest and will use this feedback to guide the board’s future direction. As a new board, we ask for the community’s patience as we execute on these initiatives. We want the community to know what we’re planning, and what actions we plan to take to work with the Ruby community and make Ruby Together a better, strong organization.</p>

    <h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>

    <p>Thank you everyone for your thoughts and feedback and, as always, the board is willing to have additional conversations. You can reach out to us in the Ruby Together members Slack, on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/board">rubytogether/board</a>, or by email at <a href="mailto:feedback@rubytogether.org">feedback@rubytogether.org</a>.</p>

    was supported by <a href=\"https://coinbase.com\">Coinbase</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cloudcity.io\">Cloud
    City Development</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digitalocean.com\">DigitalOcean</a>
    and many others.</p>\n\n<p>This month we were able to pay for 147 hours of developer
    work on Ruby open source. Thank you to all of the companies and individual developers
    that continue to support our work.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-together-news\">ruby together
    news</h2>\n\n<p>In March, Ruby Together was supported by 75 different companies.
    In addition, 2 developers signed up to be members of Ruby Together. We were supported
    by a total of 90 individual members and 68 friends of Ruby Together.</p>\n\n<p>In
    very exciting news, the folks at <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/\">Coinbase</a>
    contributed $12,750 to Ruby Together as part of their <a href=\"https://engineering.coinbase.com/coinbase-open-source-fund-ruby-edition-101c04085be0\">ongoing
    open source funding efforts</a>. They will also be contributing an additional
    $2,000 per month for the next five months. Thank you! \U0001F389</p>\n\n<p>And
    great news for your closet—we’ve got <a href=\"https://shop.rubytogether.org/products/bundler-t-shirt\">new
    Bundler T-shirts in the Ruby Together shop</a>! Shirts are available in a variety
    of sizes as well as in both fitted and unfitted styles.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bundler-news\">bundler
    news</h2>\n\n<p>Bundler saw a variety of bug fixes in March thanks to our contributors,
    including <a href=\"https://github.com/alyssais\">@alyssais</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/koic\">@koic</a>,
    <a href=\"https://github.com/MSP-Greg\">@MSP-Greg</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/nesaulov\">@nesaulov</a>,

    and <a href=\"https://github.com/greysteil\">@greysteil</a>. Fixes included <a
    href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6464\">documenting the order Bundler
    loads config settings</a> as well as fixing some <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6310\">rescue
    calls that hadn’t specified error type</a>. Additionally, we published a <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/2053d65c974f55fc15196b3ad82d7749750b2a3e/doc/POLICIES.md\">Bundler
    Policies</a> doc to supplement Bundler’s existing Code of Conduct.</p>\n\n<p>Coming
    up next, we expect to ship bug fixes, push out a small feature release, and begin
    public testing on Bundler 2.0. In total, Bundler gained 60 new commits, contributed
    by 13 authors. There were 353 additions and 97 deletions across 47 files.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org news</h2>\n\n<p>This month, RubyGems.org
    saw ongoing system updates, security patches, and general maintenance. Thank you
    <a href=\"https://github.com/dwradcliffe\">@dwradcliffe</a> for all your hard
    work!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems news</h2>\n\n<p>RubyGems saw another
    25 pull requests merged in March. We <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2182\">started
    implementing the plan for RubyGems 3</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2242\">improved
    a common and annoying warning</a>, and fixed many, many bugs.</p>\n\n<p>In March,
    RubyGems gained 73 new commits, contributed by 8 authors. There were 860 additions
    and 1,092 deletions across 66 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-toolbox-news\">ruby
    toolbox news</h2>\n\n<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n\n<p>Last month, my main focus was
    converting the GitHub stats by syncing to their <a href=\"https://developer.github.com/v4/\">GraphQL
    API</a>, which enabled the addition of a whole bunch of new project metrics while
    keeping the API rate limit consumption the same. I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDeadSerious/status/979097768177422337\">launched
    them</a> at the end of March and you can see an example <a href=\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/hanami\">here</a>—for
    instance, you can now see issue and pull request closure rates and recent commit
    activity.</p>\n\n<p>Since I bumped into some minor issues that needed extra work
    while converting to the new API, I didn’t get much time to spend on the other
    topic I mentioned in the last update: esier understandability on what the project
    metrics mean in the greater context of the Ruby ecosystem. Broadly speaking, I’d
    like to make some clear visual indicators in what range any given metric stands
    in relation to the Ruby ecosystem to make it easier to “grok” at a glance the
    healthiness of a project. For example, for gem downloads you could see that a
    given project is in the 10% most-often-downloaded gems, but for example issue
    closure rate, release activity and many more can become much more interesting
    when given this kind of context.</p>\n\n<p>This will be my main focus in April,
    and I hope to have something to show to you in this regard next month. :)</p>\n\n<p>As
    always, your feedback is very welcome. If you have any suggestions or thoughts
    you’d like to share you can do so via <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues\">GitHub
    issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you also to
    everyone who contributed pull requests in March: BurdetteLamar, apa512, boazsegev,
    cvoltz, franklinyu, funk-yourself, konung, nesaulov, pmackay, and skatkov.</p>\n\n<p>Best,<br

    our work was supported by <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/\">GitLab</a>,
    <a href=\"https://reinteractive.com/\">reinteractive</a>, and many others.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"ruby-together-news\">ruby together news</h2>\n\n<p>In February, Ruby Together
    was supported by 76 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>.
    Four companies joined as new members, including <a href=\"https://nebulab.it/\">Nebulab</a>,
    <a href=\"https://dev.welaika.com/en/\">weLaika</a>, <a href=\"http://kickass.partners\">Kickass
    Partners</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to those companies, 6 new developers signed
    up as members or friends of Ruby Together, including Stan Lo. In total, we were
    supported by 91 individual members and 68 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to
    all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>As
    we mentioned last month, Ruby Together applied to organize a <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\">Google
    Summer of Code 2018</a> project for work on any Ruby open source codebase. In
    February, Google announced projects, and our application was accepted! \U0001F389</p>\n\n<p>Now
    that we’ve been accepted, we’re  looking for mentors for students who want to
    work on Ruby open source projects this summer. For more information about what
    it’s like to be a mentor, Google has written a <a href=\"https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/\">mentor
    guide</a>. If you are interested in mentoring a student this summer, <a href=\"mailto:hello@rubytogether.org\">get
    in touch</a>!</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a student who’s interested in applying, student
    applications will open on March 12. For help getting ready to apply, check out
    the <a href=\"https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/\">GSoC Student Guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally,
    we would also love contributions to the project ideas list. If you have an open
    source project or a feature idea that are one-student-summer sized, <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygsoc/rubygsoc/wiki/Ideas-List\">add
    them here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bundler-news\">bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>Bundler
    saw some fixes in February thanks to contributors <a href=\"https://github.com/nholden\">@nholden</a>,
    <a href=\"https://github.com/voxik\">@voxik</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cpgo\">@cpgo</a>,
    \ <a href=\"https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez\">@deivid-rodriguez</a>, and <a
    href=\"https://github.com/alyssais\">@alyssais</a>. Fixes this month included
    <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6288\">a fix for certain instances
    of the “perhaps the lockfile is corrupted?” error</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6283\">clear
    enforcement steps for the code of conduct</a>. We also received <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/pull/10\">an
    awesome proposal</a> to give the <code>add</code> command superpowers, and add
    a <code>remove</code> command.</p>\n\n<p>This month, Bundler gained 23 new commits,
    contributed by 8 authors. There were 291 additions and 59 deletions across 50
    files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org news</h2>\n\n<p>In February,
    we continued to apply security patches and other updates to the servers running
    RubyGems.org. We also made progress on a new project, collecting metrics from
    the server logs about what Ruby, RubyGems, and Bundler versions are being actively
    used. Hopefully we’ll have something to show everyone next month!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems
    news</h2>\n\n<p>RubyGems saw a lot of activity this month, including the release
    2.7.5 and 2.7.6 with <em>tons</em> of bug fixes. The version 2.7.6 release contained
    some <a href=\"https://blog.rubygems.org/2018/02/15/2.7.6-released.html\">critical
    security fixes</a>, and is a strongy recommended upgrade. Get out there and run
    <code>gem update --system</code> today!</p>\n\n<p>On top of releasing new code,
    we also managed to <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2202\">write
    out the Ruby version support and release policies</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2182#issuecomment-364631805\">draft
    of a minimally disruptive plan for RubyGems 3 and 4</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In total, RubyGems
    gained 130 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 755 additions and
    340 deletions across 50 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-toolbox-news\">ruby toolbox
    news</h2>\n\n<p>After bringing the Ruby Toolbox back to life at the beginning
    of February, the rest of the month was mostly about going through a variety of
    community contributions, mostly related to changes to the <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/catalog\">catalog</a>,
    which saw 61 pull requests from 43 contributors. I also tried to improve documentation
    and guidelines for catalog contributions, based on common mistakes happening on
    that end. The Rails app itself saw a bunch of improvements to the README that
    now gives an overview of how to get the app running for local development, and
    in total saw 4 pull requests submitted by 4 contributors.</p>\n\n<p>I also did
    some research and prototyping for charts and statistics that can be gathered from
    the existing project metrics, and how to make individual project metrics like
    gem downloads easier to put into context in relation to the rest of the ecosystem.
    In addition to converting the GitHub gathering to their GraphQL library, thus
    unlocking a whole bunch of additional project metrics (see <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/94\">#94</a>),
    in March I’d like to make daily database dumps available for download to make
    it easier to get a more realistic development environment, and to bring said project
    metrics display improvements live for at least one metric to get community feedback
    on the general approach.</p>\n\n<p>As always, your feedback is very welcome, if

    and 4 companies joined as new members.</p>\n\n<p>On top of those companies, 4
    new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together, including Viacheslav
    Kysil, James Flowers, Stan Lo, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nilsding\">Georg
    Gadinger (@nilsding)</a>. In total, we were supported by 95 individual members
    and 67 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything
    that we do possible!</p>\n\n<p>We continued to fill in the remaining seats on
    the board of directors. During January, we were joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/courteneyervin\">Courteney
    Ervin</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adarshp\">Adarsh Pandit</a>. Courteney
    works for the New York Public Library system, building open-source tools to make
    ebooks more accessible. Adarsh founded and runs his own software consultancy,
    <a href=\"http://cylinder.digital\">Cylinder Digital</a>. We’re super excited
    to have their perspectives and input as we work to support the Ruby community.</p>\n\n<p>This
    month also saw a new dev hire, with long-time contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kerrizor\">@kerrizor</a>
    graciously agreeing to help with RubyGems.org support and generally making things
    better for RubyGems users.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"google-summer-of-code-news\">google
    summer of code news</h2>\n\n<p>In some new and exciting news, we applied to Google
    Summer of Code! It didn’t happen in 2017, but in 2016 we were able to run a Google
    Summer of Code project for any Ruby codebase. With around a dozen students working
    on MRI, Bundler, RubyGems, and other projects, it was very exciting. Hopefully
    we’ll have a summer of students working on Ruby OSS in 2018 as well.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"bundler-news\">bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>Bundler saw a over a dozen bugfixes
    in January, thanks to contributors including <a href=\"https://www.github.com/KrauseFx\">@KrauseFx</a>,
    <a href=\"https://github.com/akhramov\">@akhramov</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/christhekeele\">@christhekeele</a>,
    <a href=\"https://github.com/joelvh\">@joelvh</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/ajwann\">@ajwann</a>.
    We expect to release those fixes shortly in version 1.16.2. Altogether, Bundler
    gained 69 new commits, contributed by 18 authors. There were 536 additions and
    146 deletions across 57 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org
    news</h2>\n\n<p>January was a quiet month for RubyGems.org, with just 1 new commit,
    contributed by 1 author. There was 1 addition and 1 deletion across 1 file. As
    always, we also continued to apply security patches and keep the servers behind
    RubyGems.org operating.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems news</h2>\n\n<p>RubyGems
    saw a decent amount of activity this month, including bugfixes, error message
    improvements, and test updates. This month, RubyGems gained 56 new commits, contributed
    by 11 authors. There were 502 additions and 527 deletions across 63 files.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"gemstash-news\">gemstash news</h2>\n\n<p>In an extremely quiet month, there
    were no new changes to Gemstash in January. That said, there are definitely <a
    href=\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash/issues\">open issues</a> that would
    make excellent options for anyone interested in starting to contribute to Ruby
    open source.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-toolbox\">ruby toolbox</h2>\n\n<p>Hello everyone,</p>\n\n<p>Great
    news: the <a href=\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-02-01/lets-push-things-forward\">Ruby
    Toolbox is back</a> :)</p>\n\n<p>It took a bit longer than anticipated in the
    last monthly update (of course it did…), but I hope it was for the best. As I
    was chugging along on getting the site ready for launch, these tiny things that
    I wanted to be part of the initial relaunch kept coming up, and ultimately the
    site relaunched with quite a few things I had lined up for post-launch in the
    last update—the most notable of them being search—which is now already available.</p>\n\n<p>Still,
    this is only a starting point. You can find the work lined up for the next few
    weeks on the <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/projects/1\">GitHub
    project</a>, and as feedback from users starts pouring in, I’m sure there will
    be more.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, one of the main aspects I want to focus on
    in the next month is cleaning up the catalog; some categorizations are plain wrong,
    and some categories may be obsolete by now. I recently also did some <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/94\">research
    into using GitHub’s new GraphQL API</a>, and want to convert to it as it will
    unlock plenty of additional metrics that could be added to the site without hitting
    API rate limiting issues.</p>\n\n<p>See you next month! \nBest,\nChristoph</p>\n\n<h2

  content_cache: |2+


    <p>Hello, and welcome to a year-end special edition of the monthly update: Ruby Together’s Yearly Update for 2017! There are more details in the following sections, but here’s the tl;dr. During 2017, we took in $284,481.28, we spent $241,973.01, and we paid for 1,169 hours of developer work on Ruby open source.</p>

    <p>Some highlights from the year include shipping 21 Bundler releases, shipping 11 RubyGems releases, kicking off Ruby Toolbox 2.0, Bundler almost shipping with Ruby 2.5, and defending RubyGems.org against a DoS attack on Christmas Day.</p>

    <h3 id="ruby-together-news">Ruby Together news</h3>

    <p>During December, our work was supported by 76 different companies, including <a href="https://reinteractive.com">reinteractive</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a>, and many others. One new company joined in December, as well as one new individual member, Viacheslav Kysil. Last month, were supported by a total of 95 individual members and 67 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <p>In other news, please join us in welcoming a new director to our board: <a href="https://twitter.com/allie_p">Allison McMillan</a>! Among her many accomplishments, Allison recently helped organize the RubyConf 2017 Scholars and Guides program, and we’re super excited to have her perspective and experience as we make plans for 2018.</p>

    <p>Speaking of plans for 2018, there’s a big one we’ve just started working on: project applications for funding from Ruby Together. If you have opinions about how we can accept applications and start funding additional projects, we would love to hear from you! Write to us at <a href="mailto:hello@rubytogether.org">hello@rubytogether.org</a> with your input. We might not reply to every email, but we’ll read and consider them all.</p>

    <h3 id="bundler-news">Bundler news</h3>

    <p>As you may have noticed, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/25/ruby-2-5-0-released/">Bundler didn’t end up shipping with Ruby 2.5</a>. The Ruby language core team has yet to announce why they decided to remove Bundler a few hours before Ruby 2.5 was released on Christmas Day. Hopefully, we’ll find out the story there soon.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, Bundler 1.16.1 has been released, with fixes or workarounds for all known issues. If you were waiting to upgrade to version 1.16, give it a try now! If you’re still seeing issues on version 1.16.1, please <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/ISSUES.md">let us know!</a> We care a lot about fixing bugs and maintaining backwards compatibility, but we need to hear from users in order to know when bugs have crept in. &lt;3</p>

    <p>In December, Bundler gained 59 new commits, contributed by 8 authors. There were 419 additions and 301 deletions across 36 files.</p>

    <p>In 2017, Bundler gained two new maintainers, <a href="https://twitter.com/0xcolby">Colby Swandale</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hsbt">hsbt</a>. We shipped 21 releases total, which included 3 feature releases. Those releases included 1,392 commits, by 31 authors, with 21,892 additions and 5,860 deletions across 1,140 changed files.</p>

    <p>Thanks especially to Bundler’s new contributors in 2017: Abu Nashir, Adam Wanninger, Adrian Gomez, Alessandro Dal Grande, Alex Taylor, Artyom Khramov, Ashish Sehra, Atsushi Yamamoto, Brian Christian, Daniel P. Clark, Daniel Ritz, Daniel Trierweiler, David Radcliffe, Dennis Suratna, Elia Schito, emsk, Eric Boehs, Erik Johnson, fotanus, Frederico, Frederico Bittencourt, Glenn Espinosa, Greg Werbin, Grey Baker, HippoDippo, Igor Bozato, Ivan Kuchin, Jack LaBarba, Jan Krutisch, Jared Kauppila, Jonathan Pike, Juan Barreneche, Julian Nadeau, Justin Myers, Kaycee, Keiji Yoshimi, Kerri Miller, leslie.wen, Mal Graty, Michael Deering, Michael Pitman, mpd, Noah Kantrowitz, Nobuyoshi Nakada, okkez, Olle Jonsson, Patricia Arbona, Paul Nikitochkin, Piotr Kuczynski, robcole, Robert Soly, Sebastian Nowak, Shayon Mukherjee, Stefan Sedich, Stephanie Morillo, Tejas Bubane, Tristan Hill, Urabe, Shyouhei, Wade Tandy, Will Jordan, and Zach Ahn.</p>

    <h3 id="rubygems-news">RubyGems news</h3>

    <p>RubyGems had a calmer year in 2017. The biggest change was the start of merging Bundler and RubyGems into a single gem manager to rule them all. We plan to continue that work in the coming year, in addition to fixing bugs, staving off bitrot, and working to improve the RubyGems experience for everyone.</p>

    <p>In 2017, we shipped 11 releases total, with one new feature release. Those releases included 463 commits, by 25 authors, with 3,655 additions and 1,144 deletions across 122 files.</p>

    <p>We especially want to thank the new contributors to RubyGems in 2017: Alyssa Ross, anantkolvankar, Arthur Marzinkovskiy, Colby Swandale, EdOverflow, Grey Baker, HorimotoYasuhiro, Jared Beck, Jason Frey, Jonathan Claudius, Jun Aruga, Kazuaki Matsuo, Mark Sayson, Olle Jonsson, Shiva Bhusal, toru.yagi, and Tsukuru Tanimichi.</p>

    <h3 id="rubygemsorg-news">RubyGems.org news</h3>

    <p>Through a combination of luck, hard work, and frequent security patches, RubyGems.org avoided significant downtime during 2017. The two most exciting events were probably <a href="http://blog.rubygems.org/2017/10/09/unsafe-object-deserialization-vulnerability.html">discovering our years-old remote execution vulnerability was not completely fixed</a>, and scrambling to truly fix it once and for all. Thanks to David Radcliffe and Aaron Patterson for their work to implement and test a new fix. On top of that, we got to defend against a denial of service attack that overwhelmed our backend servers—on Christmas Day itself. Huge props to David Radcliffe and Evan Phoenix, who saved Christmas for Ruby devs around the world while demonstrating awesome teamwork between Ruby Central and Ruby Together.</p>

    <p>In 2017, RubyGems.org merged 336 commits by 30 authors, with 4,880 additions and 3,005 deletions across 320 files.</p>

    <p>We especially want to thank the new contributors to RubyGems.org in 2017:  Aaron Patterson, Andre Medeiros, Colby Swandale, Olle Jonsson, Shota Miyazaki, siddhantBajaj, and Yoshiyuki Hirano.</p>

    <h3 id="gemstash-news">Gemstash news</h3>

    <p>Gemstash had a pretty calm 2017, seeing some general bugfixes and enhancements but no significant activity. If you’re looking for a way to get started contributing to Ruby open source, the <a href="https://github.com/bundler/gemstash/issues">Gemstash issues list</a> has several bugs and feature requests that would make a good starting point.</p>

    <p>In 2017, Gemstash merged 75 commits by 10 authors, with 610 additions and 456 deletions across 47 files. We especially want to thank the new contributors to Gemstash in 2017: Agis Anastasopoulos, and Omer Katz.</p>

    <h3 id="ruby-toolbox-news">Ruby Toolbox news</h3>

    <p>Hello everyone,</p>

    <p>Happy new year! Holiday season was a bit involved for me, so unfortunately I didn’t find time to work on the new Toolbox in December — that obviously also meant that the planned mid-December launch that I mentioned in the last update didn’t work out — sorry for that! Sometimes you just have to cut some stuff — I actually sat down a few evenings to do some work, but quickly realized I was simply too tired to do anything meaningful.</p>

    <p>That being said, the new year is off to a good start: Import of RubyGems and GitHub stats are ready, so after adding score calculations and a bit of UI polish, the site should finally come back in the next week or two. In contrast to the last update, this will actually already include <strong>all</strong> gems, not only those in categories, and the syncing already includes a good chunk of the metrics on the old site, so adding them to the site will only mean adding them to the UI, so those should become visible pretty soon as well.</p>

    <p>After the site is launched the first thing to do will be adding good full text search. I will also prepare some “future ideas” and “easy first contribution” tickets on Github after launch, so everyone interested in contributing get a chance to do so, but first I want this website live :)</p>

    <p>As mentioned last month, you can find the current state of the site at <a href="https://beta.ruby-toolbox.com">beta.ruby-toolbox.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your time, see you next month!</p>

    <p>— Christoph</p>

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update for Ruby Together, a non-profit trade association dedicated to maintaining and improving developer tools for the Ruby programming language.</p>

    <p>During the month of July, we released two bugfix versions of Bundler, planned for the future, and made progress towards keeping RubyGems.org working for the months and years to come. Read on for more details!</p>

    <p>Last month, our work was supported by <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, <a href="http://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, <a href="http://cloudcity.io">Cloud City</a>, <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, <a href="http://www.bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, and <a href="http://rubytogether.org/join">viewers like you</a>.<br />
    If you’re not a member yet, you can learn more and help support our work at <a href="https://rubytogether.org">rubytogether.org</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>It was pretty quiet on the Ruby Together front—no new hires, but lots of ongoing work to make using Ruby easier and more reliable.</p>

    <p>In July, Ruby Together was supported by 79 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. On top of those companies, 1 new developer signed up a friend of Ruby Together, Josh Justice.</p>

    <p>In total, we were supported by 109 individual members and 72 friends of Ruby Together last month. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>A lot happened with Bundler in July! We released two bugfix versions of Bundler, version <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/v1.15.3/CHANGELOG.md#1152-2017-07-17">1.15.2</a> and version <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/v1.15.3/CHANGELOG.md#1153-2017-07-21">1.15.3</a>.</p>

    <p>In addition to industriously fixing bugs, the indomitable <a href="https://github.com/segiddins">@segiddins</a> has been working full-time over the summer towards Bundler 2.0. We made significant progress: the test suite now runs (and passes!) with all 2.0 feature flags turned on, and it is possible to build and install a development version of Bundler 2. Our next steps will be wrapping up the expected changes, and then testing and smoothing the path to migrate from version 1.x to version 2.</p>

    <p>Even though Bundler 2 will contain changes to default settings and command options, it’s incredibly important to us that all existing projects continue to work without breaking, and that each individual application can choose to switch from Bundler 1 to Bundler 2 at a time that’s best for them.</p>

    <p>In addition to the work on 2.0, there were two new RFC proposals. RFCs are detailed writeups of potential changes, describing those changes in a way that can be evaluated and discussed before implementation work starts. The two new RFCs in July were:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/blob/aa-deploy-command/text/0000-bundle-deploy-command.md">Add a <code>bundle deploy</code> command</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/blob/49e08ccf04579a92c394e438074ca7e277d036f5/text/0000-bundle-groups.md">Add a <code>bundle groups</code> command</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you’re interested in the way that Bundler handles deploys or gem groups, we’d love to hear your feedback on the open proposals.</p>

    <p>Finally, a special thanks to the new contributors to Bundler in the month of July:</p>

    <p>In total, Bundler gained 160 new commits, contributed by 14 authors. There were 7,101 additions and 1,381 deletions across 805 files.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your hard work, everyone!</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>This month was quieter for RubyGems.org, but we did regular maintenance, installed security updates, and generally kept everything running. Most of the time that we spent this month was work on an in-progress SSL troubleshooting guide.</p>

    <p>Next year, we’ll be migrating RubyGems.org to require TLS v1.2 or newer, which is why we’re focused on writing and shipping an excellent troubleshooting and upgrade guide before that happens. When the guide is finished, it will be a fantastic resource for anyone having trouble with HTTPS connections from Ruby.</p>

    <p>Merged features included dependency updates, copy fixes, and a security fix of throttling requests to change or delete user profiles. Overall, Rubygems.org gained 23 new commits, contributed by 4 authors. There were 84 additions and 66 deletions across 20 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems saw some small changes and documentation updates, but stayed pretty stable. We’ve started working with ruby-core team member <a href="https://github.com/hsbt">@hsbt</a> on getting RubyGems and Bundler to be tested together as part of the Ruby build. Once that is done, it should be much harder for changes to Ruby to break anything inside RubyGems or Bundler, which will be a huge help.</p>

    <p>This month, Rubygems gained 29 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 348 additions and 102 deletions across 23 files.</p>

  content_cache: "\n\n<p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During March, our work
    was supported by <a href=\"https://handshake.org\">Handshake</a>, <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>,
    <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com\">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bleacherreport.com\">Bleacher
    Report</a>, and many others.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-together-news\">ruby together
    news</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Phew. It’s been a long time since we posted an
    update. Some overwhelming life events happened, and I prioritized keeping the
    open source work happening over writing updates every month. And now it’s a global
    pandemic, which is not exactly un-overwhelming.</p>\n\n  <p>Trying to backfill
    everything that happened would be a herculean task, so we’ll have to summarize:
    in 2019, Ruby Together paid open source developers $233,000 for over 1,550 hours
    of Ruby open source development and maintenance work. Those hours were spread
    across Bundler, RubyGems, RubyGems.org, Gemstash, the Ruby Toolbox, BridgeTroll,
    SimpleCov, and other projects. We also ran a session of RubyMe, spending $16,200
    to ensure 6 pairs of mentors and apprentices could work together on various Ruby
    open source projects for 12 weeks. Now that we’ve summarized 2019, we’ll have
    a full update for the last month and then try to keep up from here on out.</p>\n\n
    \ <p>The good news is that we’ve got new additions to the team to keep the updates
    flowing, which should make them significantly more consistent. A very enthusiastic
    welcome is due to Irene Kannyo and Gift Egwuenu, who will be helping with content/copywriting
    and technical writing, respectively.</p>\n\n  <p>— André</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since
    our last update, Ruby Together was supported by 46 different companies, including
    Ruby members <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a> and <a href=\"https://handshake.org\">Handshake</a>.
    In that time, 4 other companies joined as new members.</p>\n\n<p>On top of those
    companies, 26 new developers signed up as members, including Matt Sias, Ollie
    Bennett, @MikeRogers0, Mike Boone, Crawford Wynnes, Philip Arndt, Jimmy Chu, Tobias
    Pfeiffer, Thomas Powell, Shupport, Brandon Weaver, Michelle Ng SY, Pascal Wengerter,
    David Revelo, Michael Verret Jr, and Jared White. In total, we were supported
    by 108 developer members. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that
    we do possible. &lt;3</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-me-news\">ruby me news</h2>\n\n<p>Although
    our last RubyMe session wasn’t in March, we wanted to highlight our successful
    RubyMe session during 2019. We received almost 100 applications from prospective
    apprentices and about a dozen applications from prospective mentors. Our budget
    let us accept six mentor/apprentice pairs, and each pair worked together for 12
    weeks between May and August 2019. They were able to contribute to several Ruby
    open source projects including <a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org\">Ruby on Rails</a>,
    <a href=\"\">If-me</a>, <a href=\"\">Dev.to</a>, <a href=\"\">Homebrew</a>, <a
    href=\"\">Gemstash</a>, and <a href=\"\">Babywearing</a> from <a href=\"\">Ruby
    for Good</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We’re proud to report that two of our mentees landed jobs
    shortly after the session closed. Congrats to both of them!</p>\n\n<p>If you want
    to know right away next time we’re able to open applications, sign up for our
    RubyMe-only newsletter at <a href=\"https://rubyme.org\">rubyme.org</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Future
    RubyMe sessions will happen as often as we are able to set aside budget for them,
    but current circumstances mean we’re not sure how soon that will be. If your company
    would be interested in sponsoring our next RubyMe session, please <a href=\"mailto:hello+rubymesponsor@rubytogether.org\">get
    in touch</a>!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"google-summer-of-code-news\">google summer of code
    news</h2>\n\n<p>Google Summer of Code is upon us again, and this year the inimitable
    volunteers <a href=\"https://github.com/hmistry\">@hiren</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/zoras\">@zoras</a>
    have stepped up from mentoring last year to running the program this year. Ruby
    Together is less directly involved, but is still providing advice, backup administrators,
    and mentorship for some student projects. Students have finished applying, and
    the selection process is currently ongoing. We’re excited to see what they’re
    able to accomplish this summer!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bundler-news\">bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>Amazingly,
    all that work that the entire Bundler and RubyGems teams have been working at
    for years has paid off in a really big way: Bundler and RubyGems have merged repositories!
    On GitHub, <code>bundler/bundler</code> is archived, and all ongoing work on both
    projects now takes place inside <code>RubyGems/RubyGems</code>. All other repositories
    from the Bundler organization have either been archived (if unused) or moved to
    the RubyGems organization.</p>\n\n<p>Not just the repositories have changed, either:
    the Bundler and RubyGems teams have merged as well. It’ll take us some time to
    work through 20 years worth of documentation and webpages, but we’ll be combining
    and updating them as fast as we can.</p>\n\n<p>From this point forward, Bundler
    news will be reported together with RubyGems news. Hooray! \U0001F389</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems news</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the huge news
    is that Bundler merged into RubyGems! Major props to @hsbt for sending the PR
    to combine repositories, as well as @deivid-rodruiguez for helping troubleshoot,
    fix CI, and get the PR landed.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that huge accomplishment, RubyGems
    saw ongoing maintenance and bugfixes, improved tests on JRuby, better deprecation
    warnings, and fixes for the internal bot that labels PRs and issues. The RubyGems
    team spent time to get more familiar with newly imported Bundler issues, and the
    Bundler team spent time getting more familiar with RubyGems, as well as the usual
    PR review and issue triage.</p>\n\n<p>In March, RubyGems gained <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/compare/master@%7B2020-03-01%7D...master@%7B2020-03-31%7D\">more
    than 10,000 new commits</a> (which includes all of Bundler’s history!) contributed
    by 21 authors. There were 96,617 additions and 961 deletions across 1,423 files.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org news</h2>\n\n<p>In March, thanks to Aditya
    and Colby we were able to update most of our gem dependencies, which included
    a security release to Rails. Additionally, he helped us fix the incorrect rate
    limit on the gem push endpoint. This should be a big improvement for users with
    high release volume like AWS, which publishes hundreds of gems every time they
    update <code>aws-sdk</code>. We also resolved some related rate limit issues with
    multi-factor authentication.</p>\n\n<p>To mitigate against typo-squatting, we
    were previously maintaining a protected list of gem names using the Levenshtein
    distance. Unfortunately, the check turned out to be too strict, and caused more
    problems than it was solving. We have disabled it for now, and we are looking
    into other ways to deal with typo-squatting. Thank you for bearing with us while
    we figure this out.</p>\n\n<p>Aditya was also able to complete a grab bag of other
    useful work, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>revisit adoptions PR/issues</li>\n
    \ <li>help a gsoc student write RFC for the ownership changes <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/issues/25\">rubygems/rfcs#25</a></li>\n

    \ <li>debug 429 for info endpoint on nginx</li>\n  <li>debug partial requests
    being logged as not cacheable by fastly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the month, RubyGems.org
    received <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/compare/master@%7B2020-03-01%7D...master@%7B2020-03-31%7D\">80
    commits</a> from 6 authors, who made 294 additions and 206 deletions across 17
    files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-toolbox-news\">ruby toolbox news</h2>\n\n<p>Hey everyone,</p>\n\n<p>last
    month I wrapped up and launched an API for Ruby Toolbox which allows you to query
    project data. While it has not received the full announcement blog post treatment
    yet, you can still <a href=\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/pages/docs/api/projects\">read
    the project API docs</a>, and an official API client is available as a gem at <a
    href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox-api\">rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox-api</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For
    this month apart from officially launching the API I will mainly investigate and
    resolve some issues on the project updates that recently emerged, leading to many
    projects displaying wrongly their github repos being gone, see <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues/615\">rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox#615</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I
    hope you all get through the ongoing crisis well and wish you all the best,\nChris</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"budget-amp-expenses\">budget &amp; expenses</h2>\n\n<p>Since our last update,
    we’ve changed bookkeepers, and we plan to use budget reports directly from the
    professionals from now on. With that said, here’s our budget for March 2020.</p>\n\n<p>In
    March, we saw $21,351.16 in total income, and spent a total of $25,995.27.</p>\n\n<ul>\n

    <h1 id="growing-ruby-together">Growing Ruby Together</h1>

    <p>Recently I joined <a href="https://rubytogether.org/">Ruby Together</a> to help grow the membership community. Having been a Ruby developer for nearly 15 years, this represents a truly exciting opportunity to give back to the community and be a part of a meaningful organization. But the first question I had to figure out was, why grow? Ruby Together has nearly 200 members, which is a great start. Our current membership base allows us to make critical security and bug fixes to RubyGems and Bundler, as well as fund mentorship programs and grants for open source Ruby software.</p>

    <p>The obvious answer is more members means more resources to improve Ruby projects. But the less obvious answers are also exciting and represent a transformative opportunity for the future of Ruby and our community. So I hope you will join me as I share why Ruby Together is so important, what we have accomplished, and what the future holds.</p>

    <h2 id="why-is-ruby-together-important">Why is Ruby Together important?</h2>

    <p>Bundler, RubyGems, and the Ruby Toolbox, the primary open source projects supported by Ruby Together, are used tens of billions of times a year. Bundler and RubyGems make up not just the most important pieces of Ruby infrastructure, but also serve as critical tools for millions of sites across the internet. Without the support of our members, we would not be able to hire developers to make improvements to these tools and reliably keep them secure. By ensuring these services remain stable, Ruby Together helps foster a diverse ecosystem of open source libraries, plugins, and repositories able to coexist among multiple Ruby, gem, and code versions.</p>

    <p>The Ruby language is also deeply intertwined with open source software. The language is open source, its most popular libraries are open source, and by and large, Ruby developers contribute greatly to open source projects. Traditionally, open source has been maintained by volunteers. While a net positive, this can pose some disadvantages, including lack of documentation, technical support, sustainability, and timely security fixes. Ruby Together was created to solve these problems by financially supporting open source maintainers, ensuring the long term success, security, and stability of the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

    <p>As the Ruby community has grown and matured, Ruby Together has played an essential role in ensuring the long term stability of core Ruby projects by paying developers, thereby avoiding having to rely  solely on volunteers. Bundler and RubyGems.org continue to serve billions of additional requests each year, making volunteer support unsustainable. Since our inception, Ruby Together has paid for over 5,000 hours of open source developer work, as well as advocated for the professional advancement of our members, and encouraged the next generation of Ruby developers by creating a welcoming and inclusive community through grant and mentorship opportunities.</p>

    <h2 id="what-else-have-we-accomplished">What else have we accomplished?</h2>

    <p>In addition to funding thousands of hours of improvements to Bundler, RubyGems, RubyGems.org, Gemstash and more, it is important to  highlight some of the other outreach and impactful work Ruby Together does for the community.</p>

    <p>Ruby Together <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-02-01/lets-push-things-forward">helped resurrect</a> the <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/">Ruby Toolbox</a>, a comprehensive resource for developers to find maintained and popular open source Ruby libraries. The Ruby Toolbox has been one of my favorite resources over the years and recently <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-05-01/time-flies">turned 10 years old</a>! Our funding has helped the site’s creator, <a href="http://olszowka.de/">Christoph Olszowka</a>, to maintain, open source, and redesign the site, as well as keep the data and projects up to date. Great work Christoph!</p>

    <p>Ruby Together also <a href="https://rubytogether.org/news/2018-09-18-announcing-ruby-me">recently launched RubyMe</a>, a mentorship program to help early-career developers improve their skills and confidence by contributing to Ruby projects, paying both mentor and mentee to pair program on open source software for 8 hours per month. To see a real world example of how RubyMe  has benefited a new developer, check out our article on <a href="https://rubytogether.org/news/2019-06-30-career-switching-into-code">career switching into code</a>. And if you are interested in participating in our next cohort as an apprentice or mentor, please check out <a href="https://rubyme.org">RubyMe.org</a> and sign up for our newsletter to be notified when applications re-open.</p>

    <p>On a quarterly basis, Ruby Together evaluates proposals for funding specific Ruby open source or community projects through our <a href="https://rubytogether.org/projects">grant program</a>. If you are looking for funding for your open source project, <a href="https://rubytogether.org/proposal">apply here</a>! Recently we profiled the progress of one our funded projects, <a href="https://www.bridgetroll.org/events">Bridge Troll</a>. Bridge Troll makes it easier to discover workshops around the world helping people learn to code. Learn more about <a href="https://rubytogether.org/news/2019-07-07-helping-everyone-learn-to-code">how Ruby Together funding has helped benefit the Bridge Troll project</a>.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, we <a href="https://blog.tidelift.com/tidelift-teams-up-with-ruby-together-to-support-infrastructure-for-every-ruby-developer">announced an partnership with Tidelift</a>, enabling their enterprise subscribers to financially contribute to Ruby Together’s open source maintenance. With this initiative, Tidelift will support and broaden Ruby Together’s reach to professional teams that primarily use other languages, but also have a lot of Ruby packages in their technology stack.</p>

    <h2 id="whats-next-for-ruby-together-as-we-grow">What’s next for Ruby Together as we grow?</h2>

    <p>Lots of great things are coming down the pipeline as we grow:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Merging Bundler and RubyGems into a single, unified project, simplifying updates and installation, eliminating version mismatches, and making the overall Ruby experience more seamless for new and existing Ruby developers.</li>
      <li>Hiring more developers to provide a steady cadence of ongoing maintenance and improvements for Bundler, RubyGems, the Ruby Toolbox, and other projects that benefit the Ruby community.</li>
      <li>Increased opportunities for <a href="https://rubyme.org">RubyMe</a> applicants and more awards through our open source <a href="https://rubytogether.org/projects">grant program</a>.</li>
      <li>Expanding <a href="https://rubybench.org/">RubyBench.org</a> into a public benchmark for every commit of Bundler, Rails, and Ruby itself. RubyBench is a long running benchmarking tool to ensure new code commits do not negatively impact performance.</li>
      <li>Creating a public Ruby ecosystem analytics dashboard with vastly expanded statistics for Ruby, Bundler, and each gem.</li>
      <li>A new member portal with news, job postings, career developments tools, and special events, along with resources to help new developers get started on their journey.</li>
      <li>Advocacy programs to encourage and nurture new programmers to pursue learning the Ruby programming language.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>But</strong>, we can’t do any of this without your help.</p>

    <h2 id="how-can-i-get-involved">How Can I Get Involved?</h2>

    <p>First and foremost, become a member!

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During June, our work was supported by <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://triplebyte.com/os/rubytogether">Triplebyte</a>, <a href="http://www.bleacherreport.com">Bleacher Report</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>In June, Ruby Together was supported by 57 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. 3 new companies joined in the last month. On top of those companies, 3 new developers joined as new members in the last month, including Balo. In total, we were supported by 119 developer members.</p>

    <p>Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <p>We had a quieter month in June, but both <a href="https://rubyme.org">Ruby Me</a> apprentices and <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> students continued to work on Ruby open source projects.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>In June, Bundler saw ongoing fixes, including better support for Ruby 2.6 and integration with ruby-core. In addition, the <code>bundle clean</code> command was fixed for git gems in a symlinked location, and the gem management task <code>rake release</code> also added support for 2FA when pushing gems to RubyGems.org.</p>

    <p>This month, Bundler gained 151 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 1,308 additions and 1,224 deletions across 137 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems.org had the usual ongoing security and dependency updates. It also saw improvements to the Fastly and Nginx configuration that will help us make it faster for newly uploaded gems to be able to be installed. Email notifications got visual design, password resets gained support for 2FA, API keys are now reset at the same time as passwords, and administrators now have more automation to deal with malicious gems or users more easily.</p>

    <p>This month, Rubygems.org gained 55 new commits, contributed by 8 authors. There were 2,458 additions and 1,961 deletions across 200 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems saw the usual ongoing fixes, including a fix for the <code>rubygems-update</code> gem that allows updating older versions of RubyGems to newer ones. David Rodriguez also did a huge amount of work on the RubyGems test suite, fixing many, many tests that either didn’t clean up after themselves or didn’t always pass.</p>

    <p>This month, Rubygems gained 103 new commits, contributed by 17 authors. There were 728 additions and 592 deletions across 37 files.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash had a calm month, seeing fixes for some rubocop and codeclimate issues, as well as fixes for some broken links.</p>

    <p>This month, Gemstash gained 4 new commits, contributed by 4 authors. There were 19 additions and 18 deletions across 7 files.</p>

    <h2 id="bridge-troll-news">bridge troll news</h2>

    <p>We’ve gotten two updates so far on work on Bridge Troll, which we’ve posted to <a href="https://rubytogether.org/news">the Ruby Together news page</a>.

    <p class="small">Ruby Together is a non-profit trade organization that funds open source Ruby projects. This is a deep dive into one of our current funded projects including the backstory on the person who submitted the proposal and updates on project progress.</p>

    <h3 id="how-one-woman-is-helping-everyone-even-grandmothers-learn-to-code">How One Woman Is Helping Everyone, Even Grandmothers, Learn To Code</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It’s really important that everyone learns how to program at least a little bit. It’s going to be part of every future job. — Rachel Ober</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a href="https://research.hackerrank.com/student-developer/2018">Over 65% of new developers are self-taught</a>. Rachel Ober is not part of that statistic. She’s among the surprising minority who learned to code in school, dual majoring in computer science and psychology—a compelling combination driven by a desire to learn how people think when they’re using computer systems.</p>

    <p>Early in her career Rachel became interested in the front end of Ruby on Rails, and during that time she became involved with volunteer-run <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a>, started by Sarah Allen and Sarah Mei. Their mission was bold and much needed: make it easier for people to learn Ruby on Rails in a welcoming and accessible environment. Even if somebody had never programmed, there was a place for them and a curriculum for absolute newbies.</p>

    <p>The free workshops, still active today, go as far as to offer free childcare. Rachel recalls an entire family, grandmother included, driving from New Jersey to New York City on a Friday night to attend a weekend workshop. RailsBridge started as a grassroots initiative in 2009 targeting an underserved community and continues going strong with “events focused on increasing diversity in tech, so that people of all backgrounds can feel welcome and comfortable in the industry.”</p>

    <p>In 2013, Rachel discovered a passion for teaching after being invited to develop General Assembly’s first Ruby on Rails course. The opportunity allowed her to experiment with teaching techniques to see what worked with new and experienced Ruby on Rails students. Tech was moving into New York City more and a lot of people interested in Ruby on Rails were expressing that it was hard to get started. All the dots started connecting and Rachel set off on a course to bring more Ruby on Rails workshops to New York City.</p>

    <p>It was through this experience that <a href="https://www.bridgetroll.org/events">Bridge Troll</a> was born as an event management tool for all of <a href="https://bridgefoundry.org/">Bridge Foundry</a>’s Bridge communities. The function is to make it easier to surface novice to advanced workshops happening around the world so that more people can learn to code. “I found out about Ruby Together through Twitter and learned that the organization funded open source projects.</p>

    <p>For Bridge Troll to happen, I needed funding to support the time I would dedicate to working on the tool, so I put an application together and made a case for it.” With her proposal reviewed and accepted by the Ruby Together board, Rachel shares updates on where Bridge Troll is today after four weeks into the Ruby Together program.</p>

    <h4 id="update-1">Update #1</h4>

    <p>Our first two weeks managing the Bridge Troll project were basically figuring out the scope of the Bridge Troll project!</p>

    <p>To give some history, Bridge Troll was created in order to make it easier to surface workshops that were happening around the world.</p>

    <p>All of our bridges are entirely volunteer-run and largely run independently from each other. This leads to flexibility, but what can occur is that organizers can feel lost or worse that there is no one else in the organization available to help them with their needs.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this real-world reality is often reflected in the code base of Bridge Troll itself!</p>

    <p>Bridge Troll was originally led by a core team of individuals who have rolled off the project over the years without finding a replacement core team to pick up the reins and lead development of features and manage bugs. Because the application had certain quirks originally meant just for RailsBridge and a USA-based workshop, we now run into problems where not all of our Bridge workshops are recorded in this important piece of software.</p>

    <p>After many discussions with Sarah Allen on this subject, our first objective, and quite possibly the only objective of this project that we will likely focus on, is to create processes and lines of communication so that by the end of the 12 weeks we will have a new core team of contributors who will be set up for success to support the application and support new contributors who would like to help us out with the development.</p>

    <p>My first objective for this 2-week period was to get introductions to the previous core contributors and begin conversations with those on the different program Boards for the different Bridge sub-organizations.</p>

    <p>My second objective was to start documenting everything that I was working on, this included:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Development log: to track what I was working on to report to Ruby Together</li>
      <li>Program Board: this can include daily updates of new files I created or documentation for the project or investigations into bugs that came in that I could triage right away.</li>
      <li>Communication log: to document who I was reaching out to and what decisions had been made</li>
      <li>Ongoing Questions file: if I had a conversation with someone and they ask something like “How do I get access to x?” and if I didn’t know how to answer that, I would add it to this file so that we could create the proper process to get people access.</li>
      <li>User Interview questions: as I began to schedule a time to talk to contributors and stakeholders, I wanted to make sure I was consistent in what I was asking them but also had two different paths depending on who I was talking to.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Contributors were those who worked in the internals of the Bridge Troll code base and know the history of why things are the way they are.</p>

    <p>Program board members and workshop organizers were users of the application itself. I want to find out more where Bridge Troll is excelling as a tool but also failing to provide the support for running workshops.</p>

    <p>There is a lot of work to be done on the project and most of it is just finding out what is the most important thing to focus on first!</p>

    <p>Sarah Allen and I have regular weekly meetings set up to track progress and bounce ideas off of each other as I work through creating processes and triage bug issues over the next few weeks!</p>

    <h4 id="update-2">Update #2</h4>

    <p>Our second two-week batch of work focused on triage of new bugs, setting up more communication channels between code contributors, board members, and Bridge Troll users, and a deep look into the <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/badge-program/">Core Infrastructure Badge Program</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Triage of bugs</em></p>

    <p>One issue that constantly comes up is who has the permissions to approve new workshops on Bridge Troll? This is a question that spans both the core contributors (how exactly does someone get permission via the code base?) and the board members (which people get permission to approve events?)</p>

    <p>The code base currently lets those who are bridge leaders, e.g. someone who is on the board, to approve events. But if that person is unresponsive—we have had issues where workshops have gone weeks without being approved—this can affect anything from attendance levels —because the workshop isn’t published on the platform—to the workshop’s organizers ability to get sponsorship funding because they can’t prove to the sponsor that the event is actually happening.</p>

    <p>After a conversation with a past core contributor, we found that we could only add new admins via a Heroku console command and made a ticket to create an admin panel in Bridge Troll itself to better facilitate this action in the future. Additionally, we added 3 new admins (including myself, another core contributor, and a board member) to pick up the slack to approve new workshops.</p>

    <p>We also recognized that the emails we send out to those who can approve workshops are ambiguous at best. The email itself does not have a clear “call to action” to say how to approve or what qualifications an event should have before approval. So that too was added to the backlog of things to address including a look into all of the emails we send!</p>

    <p><em>Core Infrastructure Badge Program</em></p>

    <p>I started to look into this after a conversation with Sarah Allen. Her feeling was that this program was a great first step to address the different parts of what a “successful” open source project includes in its documentation. I took a working session to run Bridge Troll through their system and set up a <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/2769/">public project status page</a>.</p>

    <p>Going through each of these benchmarks is a time-consuming ordeal and even after I went through it independently, I needed to also speak to Sarah about this and ask more detailed questions about whether we hit the criteria, could do better at hitting the criteria or didn’t hit it at all. We definitely were better at certain sections than others, but unfortunately, we didn’t make it through the entire document in one sitting and will have to revisit it again.</p>

    <p><em>Top Hit List</em></p>

    <p>This session we also started to develop our most important hit list of items that we felt could make the biggest impact in addition to the Core Infrastructure Badge Program that would help show potential contributors that the project was active and looking for contribution. I started investigating the way we display dates and times on the site (which ended up being quite varied!) and caused confusion to our international workshop organizers and attendees.</p>

    <h1 id="career-switching-into-code">Career Switching Into Code</h1>

    <p><em>She thought politics was her future, turns out it was programming.</em></p>

    <p><img alt="Ruby Me Apprentice Alicia" src="/news/2019-06-30-career-switching-into-code/alicia.jpg" style="float:left; width: 40%; margin-right: 5%; margin-bottom: 1rem;" /></p>

    <p>Alicia envisioned a future in politics. The California native studied political science and anthropology in college and then made the move to Washington DC to pursue a career on The Hill. After a few jobs—with a think tank, a bank, and an NGO—she learned of an opportunity thanks to <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a> DC, where other women her age or younger were problem-solving and gaining financial independence through careers in software development.</p>

    <p>Ready for the career change, <a href="https://twitter.com/OptimistAlicia">Alicia</a> dropped everything, enlisted in a coding bootcamp, moved from DC to Atlanta, and started her dedicated journey into programming. Since she started learning, her goal has always been to land a full time role as a software engineer. Today, Alicia works as a Support Software Engineer at SalesLoft and has recently been accepted into Ruby Me, a paid mentorship program created by Ruby Together giving early-career Ruby developers the opportunity to build up professional development experience by contributing to open source projects with the help of a mentor. We chatted with her about the lessons learned and what it takes to make it in programming.</p>

    <p><strong>Ruby Together: Can you describe your experience with Ruby Me?</strong></p>

    <p>Jumping into open source can be intimidating, Ruby Me has given me the confidence and paid opportunity to get my feet wet. After I left DC, I got in touch with the Women Who Code chapter in Atlanta. A friend of mine there saw the Ruby Me apprentice opportunity and I applied. The process was straightforward and when I received the great news that I’d been accepted, it was one of my proudest moments.</p>

    <p>My mentor, <a href="https://twitter.com/JuanCrg90">Juan C. Ruiz</a>, is based in Mexico and we talk once per week. We have a good rhythm—create an action plan, execute, and then write a follow up report. I’ve submitted my first pull request and realized success here isn’t only measured through the number of PRs, but also the learning you gain by working through the obstacles.</p>

    <p><strong>RT: What are you hoping to gain from this experience?</strong></p>

    <p>I’m really looking forward to making contributions to the Ruby open source community. I’m also looking to grow confidence and use what I learn to help me land a full-time software engineering role.</p>

    <p><strong>RT: What advice would you offer someone who’s considering jumping careers and getting into learning Ruby?</strong></p>

    <p>A friend of mine, Ray Gesualdo, reminded me, “don’t go solo, self-taught is really community taught.” While you’re on this path, people will lend their knowledge to help you. For example, the Women Who Code community has been my strongest and most helpful ally. I found the local chapter in Atlanta to be supportive of my learning and amazing at helping me find opportunities like Ruby Me and SalesLoft.</p>

    <p>I think it’s also wise to identify the job and company that you want and then work backwards from the skillsets. When you approach this field, it can be like, “learn everything, learn it well,” and that can be inefficient.</p>

    <p>In terms of access to educational content, there are a lot of resources online. It certainly helps, but it isn’t essential to enroll in a coding bootcamp. Just be ready to put in the work. Finding a company to hire you right out of the bootcamp can be challenging, but there are also those who are jumping right out of bootcamp into a full time job.</p>

    <p>Learning to code requires discipline, so don’t give up and keep working at it. Take feedback from people who are successful in this field and those you admire. It’s so helpful to have a community of people behind you; you’ll definitely need it. The Atlanta Women Who Code organization put me in front of my internship, the support engineer role I have today, and also the Ruby Me opportunity. They essentially helped put me on the radar.</p>

    <p><strong>About Ruby Me</strong></p>

    <p>Ruby Me is a three-month long paid mentorship program where early-career developers (with a firm grasp of Ruby fundamentals) get matched with experienced Ruby developers to work on an open source project of their choice. If you’re a recent bootcamp grad, career switcher, or developer employed at the junior level, we’re looking for you.</p>

    <p>We’re also looking for experienced developers with a knack for teaching. Mentors and mentees work together remotely up to 8 hours every month, including documenting and sharing the results of their work. Each mentor and mentee earns USD$75 per hour for their work at the end of each month.</p>

    <p>Ruby Me is run by RubyTogether. We accept applications for apprentices and mentors about once every 3 months. Learn more about Ruby Me <a href="https://rubyme.org/">here</a> and follow RubyTogether on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rubytogether">Twitter</a> to catch the next application window.</p>

  title: May 2019 Monthly Update
  slug: may-2019-monthly-update
  layout_id: 2
  content_cache: "\n\n<p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During May, our work
    was supported by Ruby member <a href=\"https://handshake.org\">Handshake</a>,
    and Sapphire members <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com\">DigitalOcean</a>,
    and <a href=\"https://triplebyte.com/os/rubytogether\">Triplebyte</a>, as well
    as many others. 1 company and 1 developer signed up as new members during the
    month. In total, we were supported by 59 companies and 119 developers. Thanks
    to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"ruby-together-news\">ruby together news</h2>\n\n<p>It’s been a busy month!
    We launched the new <a href=\"https://rubyme.org/handbook\">Ruby Me handbook</a>,
    and the second group of apprentices and mentors began their work. This session,
    there are 5 apprentices and 5 mentors. They’re working on a wide variety of Ruby
    open source projects, and some are even already seeing PRs merged. We’re super
    excited to introduce more developers to open source.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of introducing
    developers to open source, we are also administrating the Google Summer of Code
    organization for Ruby again this year. Out of dozens of applications, we were
    able to accept six students to work on their proposed projects over the summer.
    You can <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5542255322988544/\">read
    more about those projects on the Summer of Code website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally,
    but importantly for Ruby Together members, we launched new membership tiers! When
    we first started, there was just one level for developers and one level for companies.
    Over time, things got overly complicated: some monthly contributions didn’t make
    you a member, and companies had a dizzying array of 9 levels to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve
    drastically simplified and improved things: there are now 3 levels for developers
    ($10, $50, and $100), and 3 levels for companies ($500, $2000, $5000). Not only
    is that way easier to understand, it means everyone who contributes is now a member!
    All existing members have been migrated to one of the new levels, but will continue
    to pay the old price for as long as they keep their membership active.</p>\n\n<p>This
    is just the first step of our work to provide more benefits for members, so keep
    an eye on future updates for more. \U0001F642</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bundler-news\">bundler
    news</h2>\n\n<p>Bundler saw some great maintenance and testing improvements, including
    fixes for running the tests on Azure pipelines (which will mean running the Bundler
    tests on Windows!), as well as test order randomization to ensure no tests depend
    on other tests running before them. We also fixed a surprising bug where Bundler
    2.0 did not actually change git sources from http to https, despite the docs and
    warning messages. \U0001F62C</p>\n\n<p>The most exciting thing we did this month,
    by far, is <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/blob/master/text/0003-merge-with-rubygems.md#merge-bundler-and-rubygems\">moving
    forward with the Bundler and RubyGems merger</a>! As discussed and agreed on by
    the Bundler and RubyGems teams, the “maintainer” teams for both repos have been
    combined into one. Then, we reviewed all the repos in the Bundler GitHub organization,
    and archived all repos that are not currently being used.</p>\n\n<p>Next, the
    repos <code>gemstash</code>, <code>rfcs</code>, <code>gemx</code>, <code>cacache-rb</code>,
    <code>bundler-slackin</code>, and <code>ruby-ssl-check</code> were all moved from
    the Bundler org to the RubyGems org. Assuming nothing explodes, we will shortly
    move the four remaining repos:  <code>bundler-changelog</code>, <code>bundler-site</code>,
    <code>bundler.github.io</code>, and of course <code>bundler</code> itself.</p>\n\n<p>This
    month, Bundler gained 66 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 421
    additions and 493 deletions across 69 files (nice).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org
    news</h2>\n\n<p>RubyGems.org saw general maintenance and dependency updates. The
    codebase also continued to settle in on Rails 5.2, enabling the new defaults that
    come with that version of Rails. Webhooks also saw some fixes, both only being
    sent on successful pushes, and starting to be sent again on yanks.</p>\n\n<p>Overall,
    RubyGems.org gained 39 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 117 additions
    and 136 deletions across 37 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems news</h2>\n\n<p>RubyGems
    mostly got fixes this month, including for untarring files with large UID/GID
    values, as well as a bunch of test improvements and fixes. In total, Rubygems
    gained 46 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 904 additions and
    538 deletions across 29 files.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gemstash-news\">gemstash news</h2>\n\n<p>Gemstash
    got some documentation updates, as well as dependency updates, but the biggest
    change was moving the repo to <code>rubygems/gemstash</code> as part of the Bundler/RubyGems
    merge. Hooray!</p>\n\n<p>This month, Gemstash gained 13 new commits, contributed
    by 4 authors. There were 40 additions and 24 deletions across 11 files.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"bridgetroll-news\">bridgetroll news</h2>\n\n<p>This quarter, Ruby Together
    is <a href=\"https://rubytogether.org/projects\">funding a project</a> to maintain
    and improve <a href=\"https://www.bridgetroll.org\">BridgeTroll</a>. Here’s the
    introduction to her project, and we’ll post her updates to the <a href=\"https://rubytogether.org/news\">Ruby
    Together blog</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Founded in 2008, RailsBridge started
    offering free workshops aimed at introducing women to Ruby on Rails in a judgment-free
    environment. Since then, many more “Bridges” have been created with the same mission
    statement and the Bridge Foundry mother organization was created to manage the
    financial and organizational objectives for the mostly volunteer organization.</p>\n\n
    \ <p>Bridge Troll is part of Bridge Foundry’s core infrastructure, supporting
    independent community initiatives all over the world with the great potential
    to increase impact. Bridge Troll is the online engine to ensure that we manage
    the inflow of students, give a framework to prospective organizers looking to
    run events, as well as track how many students are benefitting from these workshops.
    This software helps us apply for further grant funding to ensure that we can continue
    to run workshops for many years to come. We also want to use this tool as a way
    to create processes where people can level-up through active open source work
    with opportunities for a kind and respectful mentorship.</p>\n\n  <p>Over the
    next 3 months, Rachel Ober will be facilitating work to streamline and develop
    processes to remove roadblocks from Bridge Troll’s backlog and issues database.
    The main goal during these 3 months is to come up with a process in order to facilitate
    future collaboration and contributions to the Bridge Troll project and make it
    clear what our most important goals are.</p>\n\n  <p>Rachel will be making monthly
    updates via the <a href=\"https://rubytogether.org/news\">Ruby Together newsletter</a>
    and the <a href=\"https://bridgefoundry.org/blog\">Bridge Foundry blog</a>. If
    you’re interested in more granular updates on choices and decisions during the
    project, you can subscribe to her newsletter at <a href=\"https://www.developer.recipes/\">developer.recipes</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2
    id=\"budget-amp-expenses\">budget &amp; expenses</h2>\n\n<p>In May, we saw $12,572

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During April, our work was supported by <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="https://triplebyte.com/os/rubytogether">Triplebyte</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>The big news of April is that we grew our team to include new roles! <a href="https://twitter.com/mattsolt">Matt Solt</a> joined us as our new head of growth, and <a href="https://twitter.com/monicasilvestre">Monica Silvestre</a> is our new head of community. We’re super excited to work with both of them to grow Ruby Together into a bigger and better resource for the entire Ruby community.</p>

    <p>In April, Ruby Together was supported by 60 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> and Ruby member <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake</a>. 1 new company joined as a member. In addition to those companies, we were supported by 62 individual members and 62 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>In April, Bundler saw ongoing fixes for Windows, as well as progress on getting the test suite passing on Windows in Azure Pipelines. @deivid-rogriguez continued to clean up the test suite, making it more consistent, reliable, and organized. He also tested and repaired the mechanics for upcoming deprecations messages, ensuring that nothing will break, as well as introducing <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/7052"><code>original_env</code></a> to clean up previous confusion around what <code>clean_env</code> might mean.</p>

    <p>We also fixed several other issues:
      - Bundler could sometimes try to install versions that were not compatible with the running Ruby if it was rate-limited by RubyGems.org.
      - The Bundler gemspec shipped with Ruby would sometimes be empty, because <code>git</code> is not available in the environment ruby-core uses to package default gems
      - The <code>clean</code> command would not clean up unused extensions built for git gems
      - Vendored dependencies like <code>fileutils</code> and <code>automatiek</code> were outdated
      - The <code>info</code> command was missing some intended functionality
      - The <code>exec</code> command was unable to run default gems that ship with Ruby</p>

    <p>Finally, in extremely exciting news, the process of merging Bundler and RubyGems has been <a href="https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/pull/18/">written down, discussed, and approved</a> by both the RubyGems and Bundler maintainer teams! We’ll keep you updated as we make progress on combining Bundler and RubyGems together.</p>

    <p>This month, Bundler gained 187 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 2,613 additions and 1,743 deletions across 142 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>Over on RubyGems.org, the yank rate limit was increased, password resets were updated to include two factor authentication, we added a webhook for yanking versions (thanks, @greysteil!), the Japanese translation was updated, and several other smaller issues were resolved.</p>

    <p>This month, Rubygems.org gained 36 new commits, contributed by 9 authors. There were 668 additions and 172 deletions across 43 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>Various issues were resolved in RubyGems this month, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Always expanding globbed file paths</li>
      <li>Setting permissions for non-owners on installed files</li>
      <li>Fixing <code>Gem::Requirement</code> so <code>~&gt; 5.2</code> and <code>~&gt; 5.2.0</code> are different, as intended</li>
      <li>Using <code>%x{}</code> for better Windows compatibility</li>
      <li>Removed a circular require in <code>rubygems/text</code></li>
      <li>Added missing gem wrapper for default gem Bundler</li>
      <li>Bring back prompt for version if <code>uninstall</code> has multiple version options</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to those issues, many old deprecations and other legacy code and test issues were cleaned up.</p>

    <p>This month, Rubygems gained 108 new commits, contributed by 9 authors. There were 618 additions and 219 deletions across 48 files.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash was pretty quiet this month, and only saw the test suite bumped to run against the latest versions of Ruby and some style fixes. There were 8 new commits from 4 contributors, including 8 additions and 8 deletions across 4 files.</p>

    <h2 id="budget-amp-expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>In April, we saw $13,057 in total income and $31,285.63 in total expenditure, to fund a total of 128.7 hours of developer work on Ruby open source.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>$10,000 for 66.7 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>

    <h2 id="bundler--rubygems-news">bundler &amp; rubygems news</h2>

    <p>This month, Bundler merged new helpers named <code>with_original_env</code> and <code>with_unbundled_env</code> to replace the old confusingly-named <code>with_clean_env</code>. We also started merging fixes for issues on Windows, supported by last month’s changes to run the Bundler tests on Windows using Azure Pipelines. Overall, Bundler gained 179 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 2,414 additions and 1,654 deletions across 136 files.</p>

    <p>At the same time, RubyGems saw a bunch of cleanup as well as several security fixes. Update to the latest Ruby (or latest RubyGems if you can’t update your Ruby) to prevent several possible exploits while installing and using gems. Rubygems gained 101 new commits, contributed by 9 authors. There were  494 additions and 131 deletions across 47 files.</p>

    <p>Back in January, we selected David Rodriguez for our first three-month long funded project, to work on Bundler and RubyGems. Here’s his third report from that work:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Hello everyone!</p>

      <p>It’s been two weeks with a lot of activity, not only in terms of code
    but also in terms of team discussion. We have established the goal of
    discussing the future of the bundler and rubygems integration with
    ruby-core at Ruby Kaigi. We’ve also had interesting discussions in the
    team on how to handle breaking changes going forward, and when and how
    we should deliver an upcoming release including deprecations.</p>

      <p>On bundler, I continued the work on the deprecations themselves. At this
    point, I have a clear view of the set of changes that we plan to
    release, and how we plan to deprecate the old behavior. I’m now closed
    to the point where I’ll feel comfortable cutting a release from master
    with deprecations enabled. I’ve also been compiling the work on each
    deprecation into a UPGRADING.md document that explains the reason for
    each change, and how to migrate to the new behavior. I plan to use this
    document as a draft for a release blog post.</p>

      <p>In another line of work, I’ve been polishing the CLI in general to give
    better error messages. In particular, I’m preparing a patch to thor to
    allow specifying multiple synopsis for a command. The idea here is to
    ease breaking changes like <code>bundle update</code> no longer upgrading all gems.
    In order to make this transition easier, I want to make sure <code>bundle
    update</code> gives a proper and helpful error message when being run that
    points the user to the different correct alternatives to run the
    command. Given the complicated synopsis of the current <code>bundle update</code>
    command, this patch to thor aims to make this kind of error messages
    simpler for the user to understand.</p>

      <p>In addition to all that, I continue with the regular work as a bundler
    maintainer, making code cleanups, trying to incorporate PRs to master
    that had been blocked in the past because of having to support old
    rubies, and also continuing the work on getting ready for a docker-based
    CI (which we’ve also discussed internally too).</p>

      <p>On rubygems, I continued to cleanup code in master and deprecated a
    bunch of unused methods. I also continued the discussion on how to get
    <code>gem install</code> respecting ruby version and rubygems version constraints
    on the gem being installed. Migrating rubygems to use Bundler’s Compact
    API seems like the best solution since other experiments we’ve been
    doing on making the filtering on the client side require downloading an
    excessive amount of gems, which causes installation to be unbearably
    slow. Adding support for the compact API in rubygems is the hardest
    solution, but the best one, and will also be a big step forward towards
    a future unification of rubygems &amp; bundler.</p>

      <p>Will keep you posted in future reports.</p>

      <p>Best,</p>

      <p>David.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Two weeks later, here’s his fourth report overall:</p>

    <p>Hi friends,
    &gt;
    &gt; Already eight weeks, phew. Lots of stuff going on, bundler &amp; rubygems
    &gt; are slowly becoming better software :)
    &gt;
    &gt; During the previous two weeks I kept making progress as we move towards
    &gt; a release including deprecations enabled. The more work I do on
    &gt; providing a proper deprecation path for our users, the more stuff I find
    &gt; out that needs to be done. But, I feel I’ve done a lot of progress with
    &gt; this and I’ve now gone through most things. I wrote an upgrading
    &gt; document where I talk about each breaking change, the motivations behind
    &gt; it, and what the migration path will be. I also managed to remove some
    &gt; unnecessary breaking changes and feature toggles. Besides that, I think
    &gt; all these efforts have led to the core team have a better and more
    &gt; consensual vision of the changes that will be made and their
    &gt; motivations. Many of these changes have been there waiting on master for
    &gt; a long time, so I think it was useful to have another pass over them,
    &gt; and evaluate whether they still make sense, and whether the planned
    &gt; migration still works.
    &gt;
    &gt; Something I have also made progress with is to keep improving the
    &gt; integration of default gems in the ecosystem. Default gems are great but
    &gt; require rubygems and bundler to be very careful about which gemified
    &gt; libraries they use, and when. Loading default gems too early results in
    &gt; a specific versions of them being activated, which might conflict with
    &gt; the final version end users end up specifying inside their gemfiles. I
    &gt; have fixed several of these issues, and kept improving the installation
    &gt; of default gems, making it more consistent with the installation of
    &gt; standard gems, and more similar to ruby-core’s default gem installer.
    &gt;
    &gt; We have also started several important conversations that I hope will
    &gt; lead to further progress:
    &gt;
    &gt; * The bundler &amp; rubygems merge. We started deduplicating some code, and
    &gt; I improved the current infrastructure that ensures master-to-master
    &gt; compatibility between both repositories. I also started several
    &gt; experiments about how the merge should happen. We will have deeper
    &gt; discussions with the ruby-core team about this soon.
    &gt;
    &gt; * The default Rails binstub. I started a discussion in Rails about
    &gt; whether it should become a standard bundler binstub, thus making
    &gt; maintenance easier and conflicts less likely.
    &gt;
    &gt; And as always, I try to keep fully involved in the regular maintenance
    &gt; of both repositories, by reviewing PRs, fixing bugs, making the
    &gt; development environment friendlier to other developers and keeping
    &gt; master CI’s green against the latest versions of ruby.
    &gt;
    &gt; I’ll keep you posted in future reports,
    &gt;
    &gt; Best,
    &gt;
    &gt; David.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>In March, we migrated from a self-hosted Postgres instance to RDS. After we did that, we noticed a reduction in response time of some of our slowest endpoints by up to half! It was a pleasant surprise. We also updated our webhook functionality to send requests for yank events, which will help third party applications keep their state in sync with rubygems.org. We fixed the issue of password reset not asking the OTP from users who have enabled MFA. We also dropped a dependency on an unmaintained gem (dynamic_form) and incorporated the section of code we were using into our own repository. Lastly, we added Japanese translation to our site, thanks to @m1kit.</p>

    <p>This month, RubyGems.org gained 34 new commits, contributed by 9 authors. There were 668 additions and 172 deletions across 43 files.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash had a relatively quiet month, with some ongoing investigation of a memory leak and some general cleanup and maintenance of the test suite to run against the latest versions of Ruby. This month, Gemstash gained 8 new commits, contributed by 4 authors. There were 8 additions and 8 deletions across 4 files.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>In January, we awarded our <a href="https://rubytogether.org/projects">first three-month long project grant</a>to David Rodriguez for his work on Bundler and RubyGems. Here’s his first update:</p>

    <p>Hello everyone!</p>

    <p>This is my first progress report about my collaboration with Ruby Together to improve Bundler’s release process and deprecation management. I feel really proud that I’ve been given this opportunity, and I will do my best to improve the core of the Ruby ecosystem!</p>

    <p>I have focused on several things these first two weeks:</p>

    <p>I stabilized the builds of both Bundler and RubyGems, by fixing skipped tests and flaky failures to get both CIs consistently green. This should make subsequent improvements easier. In RubyGems, I landed several bug fixes in the install and update commands. With the release of Bundler 2 supporting only RubyGems 3.0, the basic command, “gem install rails”, started failing. We reverted the RubyGems 3.0 requirement in Bundler 2.0.1 to workaround this, but I intend to make <code>gem install</code> properly fallback to installing an older version when the <code>required_rubygems_version</code> requirement of the latest version is not satisfied. However, I decided to initially focus on some misc bug fixes in the install and update commands, to familiarize with the RubyGems code base and to be able to tackle this improvement with more confidence in the upcoming weeks. Big kudos to RubyGems contributor @MSP-Greg for providing the initial work for some of these fixes!</p>

    <p>In Bundler, I started moving forward a new approach for deprecations, which will be enabled by default in the next release. We have a lot of improvements in Bundler’s master, but we haven’t released them for a long time, because they imply breaking changes. By starting to display deprecations for these changes, we’ll be closer to actually being able to release them. I also started addressing some issues surfaced by the Bundler 2 release, specifically about being too picky about the Bundler version a specific application should run. Currently, Bundler will raise if the version in the BUNDLED WITH section of the lock file doesn’t match the running version. We feel it’s premature to do this now, so I’m looking into downgrading this to a warning for the time being. I also coordinated with @colby-swandale the merge of Bundler 2 back into master, which hasn’t yet happened since the Bundler 2 release.</p>

    <p>Finally, I’ve dedicated a fair amount of time to review the integration of Bundler into ruby-core since the 2.6 release, and the “gemification” of the standard library. Thanks to @hsbt, this is now a reality, but it comes with its own set of difficulties. I’ve been studying these difficulties and creating some fixes and workarounds for them. I plan to keep working on making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone.</p>

    <p>I really hope my work is appreciated by the community and I expect to deliver better and bigger improvements in the upcoming weeks!</p>

    <p>Best regards,
    David</p>

    <p><em>This is a combined update for January and February, so here is David’s second update as well:</em></p>

    <p>Hello everyone!</p>

    <p>This is my second report about my collaboration with Rubytogether to improve bundler’s release process and deprecation management. They were a couple of exciting weeks, because I now feel I’m closer to being ready to release some of the work I’ve been doing.</p>

    <p>The following is a non extensive list of the stuff I’ve been focusing on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I continued the work on bundler’s deprecations. I reviewed each deprecation and made sure the messages are actionable, they show up when they should, and they have passing specs. In particular, I made a plan for the deprecation of the changes that are most likely to be controversial and require special care. For example, I proposed to deprecate sticky options, and custom gemfile sources (such as :github, :gist, or :bitbucket), in a smoother process that should be more friendly to our users because it happens in several steps across multiple major versions. Finally, I made sure that we use non-deprecated features in our own specs, in order to set a good example :)</li>
      <li>In addition to deprecations, I also finished the work that I mentioned in <a href="">the previous report</a> about only reporting warnings and not hard errors when we find a mismatch between the running bundler version and the version the Gemfile was created with. I hope to release these changes in both rubygems and bundler soon.</li>
      <li>I also continued to improve the integration of bundler into ruby-core. I proposed to <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6985">eliminate the <code>git</code> dependency from bundler’s gemspec</a> (which has caused problems with the integration), and raised <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15610">an issue</a> with ruby-core about where the default copies of bundler &amp; rubygems should live, and how they should get updated. I’m in touch with hsbt and we plan to discuss the future of this integration some time in the near future.</li>
      <li>Finally, I’ve been working on making our specs “docker friendly”, and making bundler testable under bare docker images of ruby and rvm. My understanding is that this should make it much easier to reproduce CI failures (or user reported bugs), and to detect version manager specific regressions (or ruby-core integration bugs). Besides that, testing on top of custom docker images is something provided built-in by Azure pipelines, so it’s a good opportunity to try it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As I mentioned in the previous report, I’m very glad to be working on bundler during these weeks. Any suggestions or feedback you may have, feel free to share them through Github, Slack or whatever means you like!</p>

    <p>See you again soon,</p>

    <p>David.</p>

    <p>In January and February, Bundler gained 110 new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 1,401 additions and 1,503 deletions across 849 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>In last two months, we updated the search API to use Elasticsearch, which resolves multiple issues including <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/972">missing search results</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/1256">slow performance</a>. Thanks to @lucianosousa, we are now using Rails 5.2.2. We would also like to let you know that we sprinkled some styling to our email templates and now they are no longer being marked as spam by some email providers. We haven’t received any new help ticket for email being lost in last month—a good sign!</p>

    <p>In mid February, we had to impose rate limit of one yank request per 10 min because we were seeing some users yank hundreds of gems at once. Our yank API endpoint was extremely slow, and hundreds of yanks at once was causing site instability. Since then we have worked hard on some optimizations and we are happy to report that we have brought down the average response time of Yank API from 4000 ms to 250 ms.</p>

    <p>In January and February, Rubygems.org gained 67 new commits, contributed by 8 authors. There were 1,177 additions and 509 deletions across 81 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems saw a bunch of commits cleaning up code, fixing bugs, and generally making things work better.</p>

    <p>We also did additional work in the background, working with security researchers to fix problems that they had discovered. You can read more about <a href="https://blog.rubygems.org/2019/03/05/security-advisories-2019-03.html">the security issues, fixes, and the latest release with fixes on the RubyGems blog</a>.</p>

    <p>In January and February, RubyGems gained 153 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 1,776 additions and 807 deletions across 176 files.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash saw a few bug fixes in January and February. In total, Gemstash gained 19 commits contributed by 3 authors. There were 22 additions and 8 deletions across 5 files.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-toolbox-news">ruby toolbox news</h2>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>in February, the main topic for me was the restoration and reintegration of historical Ruby gem download data into the Ruby Toolbox, enabling two new features: <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-02-25/historical-gem-download-charts">Historical Gem Download Charts</a> and <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-02-28/trending-projects">Trending Projects</a> which both launched towards the end of the month. I documented the process of restoring the data <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/pages/docs/features/historical_rubygem_download_data">on a new documentation page</a></p>

    <p>I also built and released a new <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-02-14/project-comparisons">project comparison</a> feature which allows you to view and compare a custom set of libraries just like regular categories or search results are displayed on the site.</p>

    <p>Since I was busy getting these done until the last minute I did not find the time yet to write the review of the last 3 months of me working on the Toolbox as my main project. I will get to that soon, so keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog">Toolbox blog</a> or simply wait for the next Ruby Together monthly update. :)</p>

    <p>As always, your feedback is very welcome, if you have any suggestions or thoughts you’d like to share you can do so via <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues">GitHub issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>

    <p>Thank you also to the PR contributors of February: alsemyonov, andyw8, havenwood, keithrbennett, kyleboe, listrophy, mbajur, pabloh, and serodriguez68</p>

    <p>Best,

    <p>Hello, and happy belated new year! Welcome to a year-end special edition of the monthly update: Ruby Together’s Yearly Update for 2018. Throughout the year, our work was supported by <a href="https://www.handshake.org">Handshake</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://reinteractive.com">reinteractive</a>, <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>, <a href="https://bleacherreport.com">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://triplebyte.com">Triplebyte</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>There are more details in the following sections, but here’s the tl;dr: during 2018, we took in $300,183.32, we spent $266,900.32, and we paid for 1,394 hours of developer work on Ruby open source.</p>

    <p>Some highlights from the year include shipping 21 Bundler releases, shipping 11 RubyGems releases, kicking off Ruby Toolbox 2.0, Bundler almost shipping with Ruby 2.5, and announcing Project Proposals and Ruby Me.</p>

    <p>During December, Ruby Together was supported by a total of 65 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, as well as 69 individual members and 64 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <h2 id="now-open-project-funding-proposals">now open: project funding proposals</h2>

    <p>Ruby Together is now accepting proposals for funded work on Ruby open source projects. Projects are expected to take between 20 and 200 hours, over three months. Proposals are now permanently open, and new projects will be selected for funding once per quarter. Selected projects and progress on those projects will be included in our regular monthly updates.</p>

    <p>You don’t need to have prior open source development experience to propose a project, and you can live anywhere in the world. The project selection committee will choose which projects to fund based on our existing budget, and Ruby Together will fund development work on chosen projects for three months.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>We’re funding one project application in Q1 2019: Bundler deprecation and release management, by prolific Ruby open source contributor <a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez">David Rodriguez</a>. Not only is he a core team member of Bundler, he is the author of Byebug and Pry-byebug, as well as on the ActiveAdmin core team.</p>

    <p>Here’s his message about the project:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>During the next months, I’ll be focusing on fixing some problems and surprises surfaced after the bundler 2.0 release, and bundler’s integration into ruby-core. I’ll also try to make sure we’re protected against the same kind of things happening in future releases. I’d like the bundler team to be able to ship bug fix and feature releases more confidently, with less regressions, and without any surprises whatsoever for users.</p>

      <p>For example,</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Users should be able to early opt in to certain new features, thus providing early feedback and bug reports without affecting the majority of the users not yet trying those features.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The default availability of certain features should be toggleable in a smooth manner, by providing UI messages announcing the change, and a migration path for users who want to either migrate early, or stay in the old behavior.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Features should be deprecatable, and finally removable through a smooth process that properly informs users about how to replace them with better alternatives.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Really basic stuff, such as <code>gem install rails</code>, should be tested at the highest most realistic level, so that regressions never happen.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>All of these ideas are currently half baked in bundler’s master, but still require some work and some actual releases to wrap them up and put them into action. My project is about making this happen.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In December, Bundler reached two huge and exciting milestones. First, Ruby included Bundler for the first time ever, including Bundler 1.17.2 in Ruby 2.6. Special thanks are due to <a href="https://github.com/hsbt">@hsbt</a> for years worth of work integrating Bundler into the ruby-core test suite and keeping everything working and up to date.</p>

    <p>Second, Bundler <a href="https://bundler.io/blog/2019/01/03/announcing-bundler-2.html">shipped version 2.0</a>! It’s a big milestone, and the Bundler team is very excited to adopt a yearly major release cadence, to better match Ruby itself.</p>

    <p>Bundler gained 55 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 225 additions and 63 deletions across 21 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>In RubyGems.org news, lead RubyGems.org maintainer <a href="https://github.com/dwradcliffe">@dwradcliffe</a> completed porting the production RubyGems.org deployment to use Kubernetes! This didn’t cause any user-facing changes, but makes it easier for others to develop locally, and will help us with our efforts to avoid downtime.</p>

    <p>Another major development was enabling two factor authentication, a Google Summer of Code project that can greatly improve the security of logging in and publishing new gems, for any gem authors who enable it.</p>

    <p>In addition to those major developments, we continued to fix bugs, improve translations, and generally keep things humming along.</p>

    <p>This month, RubyGems.org gained 57 new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 1,362 additions and 1,259 deletions across 111 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>December for RubyGems was also a big milestone: we shipped RubyGems 3.0.0! The biggest changes were S3 sources, multi-threaded gem downloads, support for two-factor authentication, and including Bundler 1.17.2.</p>

    <p>In addition to those big changes, we continued to clean up unused code, improve warning and error messages, and fix bugs.</p>

    <p>This month, RubyGems gained 149 new commits, contributed by 15 authors. There were 1,699 additions and 1,509 deletions across 270 files.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-toolbox-news">ruby toolbox news</h2>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>As mentioned in recent updates, I set aside some time and have been working on the Ruby Toolbox as my main project in December and January thanks to Ruby Together’s backing.</p>

    <p>There’s been a flurry of activity in that time. Based on the feedback I received from November’s <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-12-04/survey-results">community survey</a> I shipped the following (among many smaller improvements ):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-01-09/new-landing-page">A new landing page</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-12-14/project-health-indicators">Project Health Indicators</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-01-09/project-sorting">Project Sorting</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-01-16/bugfix-fork-detection-and-filtering">Bugfix fork filtering</a> (and, through that, improved search results)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-01-24/metrics-documentation-and-statistics">A new documentation and stats section</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-01-31/alternate-project-display-modes">Alternate project display modes</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The feedback I received so far was very positive, and <a href="https://rubyweekly.com/issues/430">two</a> <a href="https://rubyweekly.com/issues/434">mentions</a> on the popular Ruby Weekly newsletter also brought in new intereset, contributions, and feedback.</p>

    <p>Since I have some budgeted hours from Ruby Together remaining, I will continue working on the Toolbox through part of February. My main focus for that time will be bringing back historical data and, through that, bringing trending projects to the site (another highly requested feature from the community survey). As my focused time of working on the Toolbox comes to an end, I will also prepare a blog post looking back on the endeavour towards the end of February.</p>

    <p>As always, your feedback is very welcome. If you have any suggestions or thoughts you’d like to share you can do so via <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues">GitHub issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>

    <p>Thank you also to the PR contributors of December and January: FranklinYu, MrJoy, RuturajBisure, arbox, armandfardeau, bbatsell, bkuhlmann, bmedenwald, eveevans, gregors, grodowski, hsbt, janlelis, jsimpson, larskanis, mattyr, p0deje, and ttilberg</p>

    <p>Best,
    Christoph</p>

    <h2 id="budget-amp-finances">2018 budget &amp; finances</h2>

    <p>In addition to our usual monthly report, we’re including a yearly financial report. In 2018, we took in $300,183.32, we spent $266,900.32, and we paid for 1,394 hours of developer work on Ruby open source. By detail, we spent:</p>

      <li>$13,517.71  on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On top of summing up our monthly reports, this report includes year-end compensation figures for all officers of the company and members of the board. These figures have always been available to the public in Ruby Together’s tax returns, but we’re including them here to increase visibility for everyone. Company officer and director compensation during 2018 included:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>André Arko (January-July), $0 for work as a board member, $0 for work as chief executive officer, and $22,050 for work on Ruby open source software</li>
      <li>André Arko (August-December), $26,458.33 for work as executive director, and $0 for work on Ruby open source software</li>
      <li>Adarsh Pandit, $0 for work as a board member</li>

      <li>Jonan Scheffler, $0 for work as a board member</li>
      <li>Valerie Woolard Srinivasan, $0 for work as a board member</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We’re running somewhat behind from the holidays, but we’re working to catch up—keep an eye out for the January monthly update soon.</p>

    <p>Until next time,<br />
    Stephanie, André and the Ruby Together team</p>

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update—and the last update we’re publishing in 2018. During November, our work was supported by <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://triplebyte.com/os/rubytogether">Triplebyte</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>The Ruby Together team flew out to Los Angeles for <a href="https://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf 2018</a>, where we sponsored #RubyKaraoke (along with Engine Yard). At the conference, André, Adarsh, Jonan, and Valerie recorded a <a href="https://www.greaterthancode.com/2018/12/03/special-edition-ruby-together-live-from-rubyconf-2018/">special-edition Ruby Together episode</a> of <a href="https://www.greaterthancode.com/">Greater Than Code</a>. The panel discussion covers restructuring the board, the launch of RubyMe, and our upcoming project funding applications. Give it a listen if you want to learn more!</p>

    <p>In November, Ruby Together was supported by 67 different companies, including Ruby member <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake</a>, and Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. In total, we were supported by 76 individual members and 64 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>This month, we <a href="https://bundler.io/blog/2018/11/04/an-update-on-bundler-2.html">announced the upcoming Bundler 2.0 release</a> and shipped a few prerelease versions. As mentioned in the blog post, Bundler 2 will drop support for Ruby versions that are no longer supported by the Ruby core team.</p>

    <p>If you’re feeling adventurous, you can even try the Bundler 2 prerelease by running <code>gem install bundler --pre</code>. (You can even use the Bundler 2 prerelease on Heroku, with the <a href="https://github.com/bundler/heroku-buildpack-bundler2">Bundler 2 buildpack</a>!).</p>

    <p>For the less adventurous, we’re writing documentation furiously, and we will post a full Bundler 2 upgrade guide along with the final 2.0.0 release.</p>

    <p>This month, Bundler gained 44 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 331 additions and 150 deletions across 51 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>In November, we updated 19 dependencies on RubyGems.org including security updates to rack and activejob. Thanks to a report that came in from HackerOne, we fixed a bug that would allow an attacker to guess an <code>api_key</code> by sending all of their guesses as an array along with the request. We also fixed some other issues reported through HackerOne, including rate limits on forgotten password requests, and profile pages being viewable after logout using the browser back button. We also removed the only use of IFrames (GitHub stars), and updated our CSP. Finally, we now have better Dutch translations thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sharkwouter">@sharkwouter</a>, a first time contributor to RubyGems.org.</p>

    <p>This month, RubyGems.org gained 37 commits from 6 authors, making changes to 60 files with 1,796 insertions and 1,038 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems saw a lot of cleanup and bugfixes this month. We also merged <a href="https://github.com/ecnelises">@ecnelises</a>’s Google Summer of Code Project, which adds support for two-factor authentication to RubyGems.org. 2FA is a huge boost to account security, and once we have everything released and working, we’ll encourage everyone to turn it on. In total, RubyGems gained 125 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 1,532 additions and 1,500 deletions across 268 files.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>In November, Gemstash version 2.0.0 shipped! It contained updated dependencies, bugfixes, and sets the stage for adding support for the new compact index format, which is our next goal. Overall, Gemstash gained 22 new commits, contributed by 2 authors. There were 450 additions and 130 deletions across 106 files.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-toolbox-news">ruby toolbox news</h2>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>In November, I ran a community survey in preparation for working on the Ruby Toolbox full time for the months of December and January.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-12-04/survey-results">results of the survey are now published</a> and with the community’s opinion in mind I will work on corresponding improvements to the Toolbox in the next few weeks. I have also set up <a href="https://gitter.im/rubytoolbox/Lobby">a Ruby Toolbox community chat room on Gitter</a>. I’ll be reliably available for chat in December and January so please stop by and say hi!</p>

    <p>As always, your feedback is very welcome. If you have any suggestions or thoughts you’d like to share you can do so via <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues">GitHub issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>

    <p>Thank you also to the PR contributors of November: SeyZ, geraldb, mreinsch, santhanakarthikeyan, and szTheory</p>

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During October, our work was supported by <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>In October, Ruby Together was supported by 72 different companies, including Ruby member <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake</a> and Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. Three new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together. In total, we were supported by 74 individual members and 68 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible!</p>

    <p>On the events front, our developer evangelist PJ Hagerty spoke to audiences at <a href="http://www.lrtechfest.com">Little Rock Tech Fest</a> and <a href="https://gotober.com">GOTO:Berlin</a>. Sam Giddins attended the <a href="https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2018_Mentor_Summit">Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit</a>, and Stephanie Morillo delivered a talk on content strategy in open source development at <a href="https://allthingsopen.org">All Things Open</a>.</p>

    <p>At the <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/board/blob/main/meetings/2018-10-16-board-meeting.md">monthly board meeting</a>, the directors gave final approval to open applications for OSS project proposals to fund, approved a DevRel position job description, and agreed to sponsor Ruby Karaoke at RubyConf.</p>

    <p>If you’ll be at RubyConf in LA next week, the board would love to meet with you to hear your feedback and talk about Ruby Together. Just <a href="hello@rubytogether.org">let us know</a>. &lt;3</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p><a href="https://bundler.io/blog/2018/10/25/announcing-bundler-1-17-0.html">We released Bundler 1.17</a>, which ships a new <code>remove</code> command (for removing gems from the command line), new command options, new events for Bundler plugins, and new environment variables. For a complete list of changes, check out the <a href="https://bundler.io/v1.17/whats_new.html">v1.17 release notes</a>.</p>

    <p>We also announced our <a href="https://bundler.io/blog/2018/11/04/an-update-on-bundler-2.html">new plan for Bundler 2.0</a>, a new approach that we think the Bundler team and Bundler users will both be excited about. We’re planning to write more blog posts and documentation about Bundler 2, and push a prerelease preview for interested beta testers in the next week or two.</p>

    <p>This month, Bundler gained 107 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 473 additions and 156 deletions across 35 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>In October, we updated 23 dependencies, including the update to Rails 5.2 (thanks <a href="https://github.com/thomasdziedzic">@thomasdziedzic</a>) and a security update to loofah. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/fwilkens">@fwilkens</a>, we added a new endpoint to our API which can be used to <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#get---apiv1timeframe_versionsjson">query for gem updates within a given time range</a>. We also merged improvements to the French and Chinese translations of our site.</p>

    <p>Early in October, we had to disable the endpoint that powers the reverse dependencies list on the website, because it was interfering with the stability of the rest of the site. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. We’ve since done significant work to improve that endpoint’s performance, and it is back online. Unfortunately, this meant, we had to say goodbye to one of our beloved libraries, will_paginate, which we <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1807">replaced with kaminari</a>.</p>

    <p>We also undertook some refactoring work to improve our Code Climate score and we are happy to report that our maintainability score is an A!</p>

    <p>This month, RubyGems.org gained 55 commits from 7 authors, making changes to 72 files with 342 insertions and 1226 deletions.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>RubyGems changes this month included removing insecure DNS lookups on gem servers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/arlandism">@arlandism</a>!), fixed an issue where RubyGems might load files from a different copy of RubyGems on disk (thanks <a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez">@deivid-rodriguez</a>), and did ongoing administration and maintenance. We also merged in changes from ruby-core, improving compatibility with the upcoming Ruby 2.6.</p>

    <p>This month, RubyGems gained 49 new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 747 additions and 604 deletions across 73 files.</p>

    <h2 id="gemstash-news">gemstash news</h2>

    <p>Gemstash saw a few bug fixes this month, including a fix to prevent overriding a published gem. This month, Gemstash gained 9 new commits, contributed by 3 authors. There were 71 additions and 4 deletions across 7 files.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-toolbox">ruby toolbox</h2>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>With freelance projects winding down in November, the Ruby Toolbox will be my main focus for December and January. Over the next two months, I will work on new features and improvements on the Ruby Toolbox. You can also check out the <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-11-05/community-survey">related announcement on the Toolbox blog</a>.</p>

    <p>In order to be able to focus on what is relevant to you, the community, I have set up a survey to gather your feedback. If you have a couple minutes to spare it would be wonderful if you could leave your thoughts on what you’d like to see over at the <a href="https://survey-2018.ruby-toolbox.com/">Ruby Toolbox 2018 Community Survey</a>. Thanks a lot for your time!</p>

    <p>If you are interested in contributing to the Ruby Toolbox, December and January will also be a great time to get started as I’ll be available on a regular basis for replying to any questions you have or ideas you’d like to discuss. I will set up a project chat room for this; please keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog">Toolbox blog</a> for announcements.</p>

    <p>Because of this, I’m delaying planned improvements of the search I mentioned in the last update so I can spend some consecutive time on that and also incorporate any feedback that might come from the community survey. Those improvements will remain on the roadmap, with work to commence sometime next year.</p>

    <p>As always, your feedback is very welcome, if you have any suggestions or thoughts you’d like to share you can do so via <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues">GitHub issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>

    <p>Thank you also to the PR contributors of October: HotFusionMan, alsemyonov, cybcafe, and go2null.</p>

    <p>Best,
    Christoph</p>

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During September, our work was supported by <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://triplebyte.com/os/rubytogether">Triplebyte</a>, <a href="http://www.bleacherreport.com">Bleacher Report</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>In September, Ruby Together was supported by 73 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. <a href="https://triplebyte.com/os/rubytogether">Triplebyte</a> joined as our newest Emerald member.</p>

    <p>In addition, eight new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together, including Rafael França. In total, we were supported by 77 individual members and 69 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible.</p>

    <p>As mentioned last month, we solicited suggestions or applications to run in the yearly election for the Ruby Together board of directors. This year, the only candidate was our existing board member, Adarsh Pandit. Since there was only one candidate, and one board seat up for election, the remaining directors chose to skip the voting period this year. If you’re interested in nominating someone for the board of directors next year, or even running yourself, we’d love to hear from you! Reach out to us at hello@rubytogether.org and we can give you more information.</p>

    <h3 id="ruby-me">ruby me</h3>

    <p>Earlier this month, we announced a new, paid mentorship program called <a href="http://www.rubyme.org">Ruby Me</a>. Designed and planned by board member Coraline Ada Ehmke, Ruby Me pairs early-career developers with seasoned Rubyists to work on open source projects for three months. Both mentees and mentors are compensated for 8 hours of work per month. The goal of Ruby Me is to help bring people from underrepresented backgrounds into open source and support them in their professional growth.</p>

    <p>We saw an overwhelmingly positive response come from the wider community. In one week, we received over 900 applications from prospective apprentices and over 125 applications from prospective mentors. It was incredibly difficult, but we selected the participants for our first batch and sent out notification emails on October 1. The selected teams will work together until January 2019, and we’ll be sure to report back on how things went.</p>

    <p>We plan to open applications for Spring 2019 around the middle of December. If you’d like to get an email right away when we next open applications for Ruby Me, visit <a href="https://rubyme.org">rubyme.org</a> and sign up to be notified at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h3 id="events">events</h3>

    <p>Coraline Ada Ehmke and Kerri Miller gave talks at CodeDaze in Buffalo, NY earlier in September, and PJ Hagerty visited Northeast PHP in Boston.</p>

    <h2 id="bundler-news">bundler news</h2>

    <p>The Bundler team merged 29 pull requests, including fixes for nested <code>bundle exec</code>, various bugs around choosing and updating gem versions, documentation improvements, and full compatibility with TruffleRuby. We also released versions 1.16.5 and 1.17.0.pre.</p>

    <p>We also decided how to drop backwards compatibility with old Ruby versions, allowing us to resume work to merge Bundler into Ruby 2.6. We may or may not complete everything in time for the Ruby 2.6 release at Christmas, but we’re still working towards it!</p>

    <p>In September, Bundler gained 73 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 419 additions and 151 deletions across 40 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">rubygems.org news</h2>

    <p>This month, we updated seven dependencies on rubygems.org and simplified and sped up some rack-attack integration tests with the help of <a href="https://github.com/mjankowski">@mjankowski</a>. We also discovered that it was possible to create “hidden” gems that would not show up in gem lists, and <a href="https://github.com/kerrizor">@kerrizor</a> implemented a fix. Overall, rubygems.org got 15 commits from 2 authors making 146 additions and 263 deletions across 8 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>This month, RubyGems merged 12 pull requests, including downloading multiple gems in parallel during <code>install</code>, setting up a new mergebot, and adding a <code>--resign</code> flag to the <code>cert</code> command. There were 26 new commits, contributed by 6 authors, with 251 additions and 163 deletions across 28 files.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-toolbox">ruby toolbox</h2>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>I set aside some time in September to ship the production database exports I’ve mentioned in recent updates.</p>

    <p>You can <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-09-30/database-exports">find the release announcement and more in this on the Ruby Toolbox blog post</a>. If you’d like to run some stats against the Toolbox data set, or if you’d like to get a local data set for development and contributing, this should be very helpful. You can find the exports at <a href="https://data.ruby-toolbox.com">data.ruby-toolbox.com</a>.</p>

    <p>I also spent a bit of time on general maintenance, like upgrading the production database to Postgres 10 or <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/294">fixing a bug</a> that prevented gems with only pre-release versions available on rubygems.org from being indexed on the Toolbox.</p>

    <p>Getting the database dump export process ready with all the <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/backup_publisher#goals">goals</a> I had for it took a bit more time than I had hoped, so I didn’t get around to work on <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues/109">the improvements to the search</a> I also mentioned in the last update; I will work on it in October.</p>

    <p>As always, your feedback is very welcome! If you have any suggestions or thoughts you’d like to share you can do so via <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues">GitHub issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>

    <p>Thank you also to the contributors who submitted PRs in September: gettalong and matkoniecz.</p>

    Christoph</p>

    <p>A paid mentorship program for early-career Ruby developers.</p>

    <p>Ruby Together is extremely excited to announce a new program, designed by Coraline Ada Ehmke: <a href="https://rubyme.org">Ruby Me</a>.</p>

    <p>The mission of the RubyMe program is to help early-career developers improve their skills and confidence by contributing to Ruby open source projects, by paying them to pair on open source software for 8 hours per month. Through this program we hope to give these developers the skills and experience that they need for continued growth and success in their careers.</p>

    <p>Early-career developers (with a firm grasp of Ruby fundamentals) can apply for a spot in the three-month long program. If you’re a recent bootcamp grad, career switcher, or developer employed at the junior level, we’re looking for you.</p>

    <p>Once selected, apprentices will be matched with an experienced Ruby developer. Together, they’ll choose an open source project to work on, and a goal to work towards during the three-month program.</p>

    <p>Mentors and apprentices will meet and work together up to 8 hours every month, including documenting and sharing the results of their work. Each mentor and apprentice will be paid USD $75 per hour for their work.</p>

    <p>We are accepting a limited number of applications for the pilot program that will run October through December of this year, and then open up for a new and larger cohort in January of 2019.</p>

    <p>Learn more or apply today to participate as an apprentice or a mentor at <a href="https://rubyme.org">rubyme.org</a>.</p>

    of Ruby Together you would want to represent you on the board of directors? Would
    you like to run for the board yourself? You have one week to <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/lshnSf7r0n1ruIpR2\">nominate

    talking with other developers about Ruby Together.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"summer-of-code\">summer

    their work on our various projects. Special thanks to our GSoC developers for
    all of their hard work these past few months! Check out the work done by those
    students in their final write-ups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Qiu Chaufan, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/ecnelises/9654e59877aa336977c1409ef540e2a9\">Adding

    functionality from <code>bun</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"reorganization-for-the-long-run\">reorganization
    for the long run</h3>\n\n<p>It’s hard to believe, but Ruby Together is more than
    three years old. In that time, we’ve grown from funding just 2 devs working 10
    hours per week, to funding up to 50 hours per week when it’s needed to keep Ruby’s
    gem infrastructure running smoothly.</p>\n\n<p>As you can probably imagine, it
    takes a lot more to organize ten developers than it took to organize two. Because
    of that, we’re making some changes to how Ruby Together is structured to make
    sure all of that work continues to get done.</p>\n\n<p>Starting this month, we’re
    retiring our existing position of CEO, and replacing it with an Executive Director
    position. While it includes many of the previous responsibilities of the CEO,
    the ED position comes with a new job description, new criteria for success, and
    direct oversight by the board of directors.</p>\n\n<p>The Executive Director will
    not be a member of the Board of Directors, and will not determine budgets or spending.
    Instead, they will be responsible for running Ruby Together on a day to day basis,
    implementing the strategy and plans decided on by the board.</p>\n\n<p>The Executive
    Director will be paid for administrative and corporate work. They will not be
    paid for any open source work. This will allow them to focus their efforts on
    fundraising and collaboration with the Ruby community. Our first Executive Director
    will be André Arko.</p>\n\n<p>Along with the new ED position, we’re resetting
    the size of the board of directors to 5 people. No one is being added or removed
    from the board to make that happen, but that size will keep our core working group
    in the 5-7 person range. Keeping the core working group small and focused is especially
    important for our scheduling, discussion, and decision-making, and the board was
    in unanimous agreement that the new size will improve our work.</p>\n\n<p>We’re
    excited to enter a new phase as a “grown up” non-profit, and we’re looking forward
    to being able to support the Ruby open source community for years to come. \U0001F48E\U0001F49D</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"bundler-news\">bundler news</h2>\n\n<p>With the help of <a href=\"http://github.com/eanlain\">@eanlain</a>,
    we shipped a new guide: <a href=\"https://bundler.io/v1.16/guides/bundler_docker_guide.html\">“How
    to use Bundler with Docker”</a>. We also dramatically improved error messages
    when version requirements conflict, shipped a playbook for adding or removing
    core team members, and fixed some issues handling gemspecs with non-ASCII characters.
    We also merged a fix that could cause Bundler to <a href=\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6675\">fail
    when trying to install a gem that has had a version yanked recently</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On
    top of that code work, we also added two new contributors to <a href=\"https://bundler.io/contributors.html\">the
    Bundler team</a>! Welcome to <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/radiomorillo\">Stephanie

    ways to protect RubyGems.org from malicious gems—if you’re interested in helping
    work on that, let us know! We also reviewed and merged performance improvements

    RubyGems, we fixed some bugs, including the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2380\">auto
    re-sign expired certs</a>, fixed some tests, and made sure that gems with <code>allowed_push_host</code>

    everyone,</p>\n\n<p>Despite my ambitious announcements in the last update, August
    turned out to be a quiet month for me. I was mostly on vacation visiting family,
    and while I had hoped to use the available time to also build a bunch of nice
    stuff for the Toolbox, the need to find some rest and to have a bunch of time
    with family and away from computers won in the end.</p>\n\n<p>However, I’ll finally
    have the time to ship the public data dumps and search improvements in September
    I spoke about in recent updates!</p>\n\n<p>In other news, towards the end of August
    I was in Vienna for the 2018 edition of Euruko, the European Ruby Conference.
    I’d like to say a big thank you to everyone involved, I think it was a great weekend
    and a powerful display of the health of our community. Can’t wait for next year!</p>\n\n<p>As
    always, your feedback is very welcome, if you have any suggestions or thoughts
    you’d like to share you can do so via <a href=\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues\">GitHub
    issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you also to
    the contributor of our sole pull request in August: jrochkind (it seems there
    were more folks on vacation).</p>\n\n<p>Best,\nChristoph</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"budget-amp-expenses\">budget

    the two projects into one repository.</p>\n\n<p>RubyGems changes in April included
    a fix for a recent regression in RubyGems to interfere with common bundler usages,
    improvement to a missing spec error, and shipping a new RSpec runner that works
    better with parallelization. We also updated our CI to ruby 2.7 and made a PR

    in MFA enabled accounts (Thank you <a href=\"https://github.com/aditya\">@aditya</a>!).</p>\n\n<p>In

Stripe has been a a part of Ruby Together since before it even began, when their CTO Greg Brockman came forward to sponsor development and maintenance work on Bundler. That sponsorship proved that the concept of community-funded infrastructure was feasible, and ultimately led André Arko to found Ruby Together.</p>

    <p>Stripe continues to <a href="/#join">support Ruby’s public infrastructure</a> both now and in the future as a member of Ruby Together, and we’re very happy about that.</p>

    <p>Since before Ruby Together even launched, supporting and improving <a href="/roadmap">public Ruby infrastructure</a> has been our goal. Although we decided to focus on Bundler and Rubygems.org as our first two projects, we already had our eye on <a href="http://rubybench.org">RubyBench</a> as a project to support.</p>

    <p>RubyBench provides public benchmarks, running a large suite of performance tests against every commit of Ruby. It also benchmarks every commit to Rails against the performance benchmark suite of the Discourse project. These two benchmarks combined provide massive utility to Ruby developers around the world.</p>

    <p>With historical and current performance information, it is possible to find performance regressions quickly, as well as release new versions with confidence that performance has stayed the same or gotten even better. This assurance allows developers to upgrade their projects to newer versions of Ruby and Rails more frequently, more easily, and with greater confidence.</p>

    <p>Today, I’m happy to announce that Ruby Together has agreed to fund the server hardware that runs the RubyBench benchmark suite, taking over for RubyBench founding sponsor <a href="http://rubytune.com">Rubytune</a>. In addition to funding the server hardware, Ruby Together plans to fund work maintaining and expanding RubyBench in the future.</p>

  content_cache: "\n<p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During June, our work
    was supported by <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bleacherreport.com\">Bleacher
    Report</a>, <a href=\"http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/\">Stitch Fix</a>, and
    many others.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-together-news\">ruby together news</h2>\n\n<p>In
    June, Ruby Together was supported by 44 different companies, including Ruby member
    <a href=\"https://zendesk.com\">Zendesk</a> and Sapphire member <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a>.
    Those companies were joined by 102 developer members. Thanks to all of our members
    for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rubygems-news\">rubygems
    news</h2>\n\n<p>In June, RubyGems saw significant improvements to the Bundler
    and RubyGems development process. We released <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/releases/tag/bundler-v2.2.0.rc.1\">Bundler
    2.2.0.rc.1</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/releases/tag/v3.2.0.rc.1\">RubyGems
    3.2.0.rc.1</a>! \U0001F389</p>\n\n<p>We also worked on synchronizing the latest
    versions of both libraries with ruby-core, and fixed issues that came up. We also
    <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3725\">enforced our ruby-core
    workflow</a> to try to prevent further tedious integrations with ruby-core in
    the future by catching issues early and minimizing the back and forth of patches
    between upstream and downstream.</p>\n\n<p>We changed <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3685\">bundler
    specs to raise by default when any subcommand fails</a>. This action helped reveal
    two bugs (which we of course, fixed!). We’ve adapted bundler release tasks to
    a <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3703\">new repository layout</a>
    and now have the changelog draft up-to-date.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve also implemented
    a fix to <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3668\">stop soft-validating
    gemspecs</a> (i.e. giving validations that only warn) except for in gem-authoring
    contexts. We also added a <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3689\">slack
    notification</a> to the maintainers channel that triggers whenever the ruby-head
    builds starts failing. We also <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3769\">simplified
    our CI Workflows</a> and did some final cleanup PRs related to CI failures on
    jruby.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of these major highlights, we continue to fix bugs, review
    PRs, improve our documentation, cleanup test suites, and continue our usual ongoing
    maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>In total, RubyGems gained 243 new commits, contributed
    by 15 authors. There were 3003 additions and 2432 deletions across 313 files.</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"rubygemsorg-news\">rubygems.org news</h2>\n\n<p>This month, we added terraform
    module for RDS monitors and added alerts on <code>rubygems-production</code>,
    <code>rubygems-staging</code> and <code>shipit</code> instances. We followed up
    with fixes on RubyGems.org that have now been deployed and verified! We also debugged
    failed delayed jobs in production, created a <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/2389\">fix
    for issues with validating user emails</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/2406\">solved
    some search errors</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/2388\">removed
    some pointless emails</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that, we made a PR to <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/2392\">send
    mail update confirmation when a user changes their email address</a>, added a
    RubyGems.org guide for rate limits, and made the following improvements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n
    \ <li>\n    <p>increased Strict-Transport-Security max-time to ensure HTTPS-only
    access.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>updated <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/2382\">rake
    task to remove duplicate runtime dependencies</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>updated
    <code>versions.list</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/2380\">source
    location from bundler-api to s3</a> and added cronjob to update the file monthly.</p>\n
    \ </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>ran rake tasks related to <code>compact_index</code> which
    enabled bundler to make fewer requests to our server when installing some gems
    and fixed install of gems with multiple Ruby or Rubygems requirements.</p>\n  </li>\n
    \ <li>\n    <p>updated correct checksum task to use non-caching info_checksum
    calc, rerun the task, and expire info cache of gems changed from production.</p>\n
    \ </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a href=\"http://https://github.com/rubygems.org/pull/1962\">rebased
    and updated API keys scope PR</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>updated and deployed
    rate limit changes to fix merge conflict and use test helpers. <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems.org/pull/2330\">rubygems.org#2330</a></p>\n
    \ </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>reset a few leaked API keys and send mail to affected
    users.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As always, we continued to fix bugs, and provide

    <p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During July, our work was supported by <a href="https://www.zendesk.com">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="http://www.bleacherreport.com">Bleacher Report</a>, and many others.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-news">ruby together news</h2>

    <p>In July, Ruby Together was supported by 44 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, and 102 developer members. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>In July, we improved <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3784">Bundler’s Issue Template</a> for our maintainers and contributors. We also worked on <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3793">improving performance optimizations</a>, and simplified our CI Workflow to make all <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3769">Bundler testing combinations easier to maintain.</a></p>

    <p>We made improvements and cleaned up PRs related to JRuby (<a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3770">#3770</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3771">#3771</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3774">#3774</a>) and merged a follow up <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3765">PR to have a clean rubocop on new gems.</a></p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3789">We implemented <code>gem update --system --silent</code></a> and configured RubyGems branch protection. We’ve also fixed <code>rake release</code> failing in the following instances:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3783">when the credentials file is missing</a></li>
      <li>when a deprecation warning is triggered in the Github API</li>
      <li>when all <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3785">local tags are pushed instead of only the release tag.</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Finally, we proposed a <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3792">new workflow for managing our changelog</a> and merged more PRs integrating this workflow. <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3808">#3808</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3798">#3798</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3807">#3807</a>.</p>

    <p>As always, we continue to fix bugs, review PRs, follow up with issues and perform ongoing maintenance.</p>

    <p>This month, RubyGems and Bundler gained 227 new commits, contributed by 15 authors. There were 146 additions and 170 deletions across 1,070 files.</p>

    <p>We’ve migrated to sidecar nginx proxy running on EKS cluster from legacy SPOF nginx running on a dedicated host. We also updated our EKS cluster to v1.16.</p>

    <p>Over on <a href="help.rubygems.org">help.rubygems.org</a> we resolved tickets, fixed a TypeError on the signup page, and removed unused daemons gems from the Gemfile.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>This month we made improvements to our <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3923">man page generation process</a> to ease contribution to the Bundler documentation, and reviewed and merged some PRs from various contributors. We’re thankful for our supportive community. &lt;3</p>

      <li>ran the backfill task in production, regenerated the <code>versions.list</code> file, verified <code>info_checksum</code> mismatches, and purged info keys on memcached and Fastly. This will ensure <code>bundle install</code> is able to run quickly when resolving more than 30k gem versions that previously caused <code>Gem::RuntimeRequirementNotMetError</code>.</li>
      <li>added Terraform modules for CloudWatch alerts on <code>alb</code>, <code>ec</code>, <code>es</code>, <code>rds</code> and <code>sqs</code>, and created alert thresholds.</li>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>I hope you’re well! I added displaying of repo README files to the Ruby Toolbox recently, which will hopefully be useful for quickly evaluating projects more in depth on top of the usual metrics directly on the site. Apart from that and the usual maintenance some topics I have looked into recently are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Bringing lines-of-code stats to the site so you can have an indication of the size and complexity of the library at a glance. This is the one I hope to ship next</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An official command line client that gives you quick access to data served by the recently launched API, including a report on the health status of your dependencies</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Looking into options for improving the search, especially the response times</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Providing an alternate database dump that excludes historical gem download stats, since they make up the majority of the dump size and make imports very slow, so if you just want some real data to work with it’s become a bit cumbersome at this point</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be safe and stay healthy!</p>

    <p>Best,
    Chris</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems-news">rubygems news</h2>

    <p>In October we released Bundler version <code>2.2.0.rc.2</code> and RubyGems version <code>3.2.0.rc.2</code>.</p>

    <p>In addition to shipping those releases, we also:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>upgraded Bundler &amp; RubyGems vendored Molinillo to <strong>0.7.0</strong> (it’s latest release). - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3402">#3402</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3388">#3388</a></li>

    <p>We also made the following changes and improvements:</p>

    <ul>

    <p>All of the infrastructure used by Ruby developers today, including Bundler, RubyGems, and <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems.org</a> is maintained and developed by volunteers.  While it’s good that no one company controls resources shared by the community, it’s terrible that the only people who work on our shared infrastructure are doing so for free and in their spare time.</p>

    <p>Ruby Together was founded so the community can cooperate to solve that problem. It will fund on-call rotations, maintenance work, and improvements to the <a href="/roadmap">shared, public infrastructure</a> used by the entire community.</p>

    <p>We’ll also provide <a href="/companies">benefits just for members</a>. To begin with, opportunities to connect and exchange knowledge, turning <a href="https://rubybench.org">RubyBench.org</a> into a fully-fledged community performance benchmarking resource, and tracking and reporting on important deprecations and security issues for members.</p>

    <p>The community that has grown up around Ruby is amazing, and provides many fantastic (and fantastically useful) tools that any developer can use. Let’s work together to make sure those tools (and the community) are the best that they can be, for everyone.</p>

    <p>If you or your company has benefited from the free and open-source tools available in Ruby, support those tools by becoming a member of Ruby Together. Membership dues directly fund work that benefits everyone using Ruby, and are usually tax-deductible. Both individual and corporate memberships are available. <a href="/">Join us today</a>!</p>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>I hope this update finds you well! Last month I have been busy with all kinds of general maintenance work, like fixing random failures in the Ruby Toolbox visual regression CI tests, a whole set of dependency upgrades, renaming default git branches to main across rubytoolbox repos and fixes on webhook reception.</p>

    <p>As mentioned in my last update I’m currently also working on bringing gem dependencies display to the Ruby Toolbox. The data is in place and I have been working on showing it on the site. In that regard I have settled on the UI layout for this feature but still have to spend a bit more work on this to make it ready for production, but I hope to get this ready in May.</p>

    <p>Stay safe and healthy and until next time!</p>

    <p>Best,
    Chris</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-api-news">ruby API news</h2>

    <p>This month for Ruby API I have been working on importing the core Ruby type signatures using the RBS gem where the current definitions are being maintained. Our aim is for the type signatures be parsed inside Ruby API so they can be presented to the user in an easy to understand and digestible fashion.</p>

    <p>We’ve also been working hard on merging PRs from our contributors and keeping our dependencies up to date.</p>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>I hope this update finds you well!</p>

    <p>I have recently worked on improving the search response times on the Ruby Toolbox as they had become pretty unbearable in recent months. After some initial prototyping had shown promising results I decided to swap the search index to utilize MeiliSearch instead of Postgres’ built-in full text search. Benchmarks between both on the live site showed that this changed response times from ~13 seconds back to a more reasonable
    ~1 second. You can also find a <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2021-03-19/search-speed-improvements">corresponding blog post on the Ruby Toolbox.</a></p>

    <p>I have also upgraded the site to <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/801">run on Ruby 3</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/800">latest version of Rails</a> early this year.</p>

    <p>Next up I want to bring display of a gem’s dependencies (and reverse dependencies later on) to the site and have some follow-up work in removing code regarding the old search indexing.</p>

    <p>Stay safe and healthy and until next time!</p>

    <p>Best,
    Chris</p>

    <p>Hey everyone!</p>

    <p>As mentioned in the last update I’ve been working on bringing gem dependencies to the Ruby Toolbox project pages, and I’m happy to say that via this pull request they have now been launched. You can find them on each project page, for example take a look at the http gem over here.</p>

    <p>A specialty of this feature is that right next to the dependency you can also find the corresponding project health indicators so if you’re looking at a library you can also see an indication of the status of it’s dependencies as well.</p>

    <p>Now that this is out of the door, in June I want to spend a bit of time on maintenance of the data syncing mechanisms as they haven’t received much attention apart from being built at some point and are causing some noise for example when API rate limits are hit.</p>

    <p>Stay safe and healthy and until next time!</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-together-and-ruby-central-coming-together">Ruby Together and Ruby Central, coming together</h2>

    <p>Since Ruby Together was first started, we’ve worked together with <a href="https://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a>. While Ruby Central has paid the server bills for RubyGems.org, Ruby Together has paid the software developers who keep it running. That cooperation has benefited the entire Ruby community for the last 6 years, ever since Ruby Together began.</p>

    <p>While the cooperation has been beneficial, it’s been hard to explain. Many community members are surprised to learn that Ruby Together and Ruby Central are separate non-profits, and even those who know they are distinct struggle to keep track of exactly which one does exactly what things.</p>

    <p>Last year, Ruby Together board member Jonan Scheffler pitched an idea: what if we were just one organization? After some non-profit business paperwork-handling, we’re proud to announce that dream has become a reality. Ruby Together and Ruby Central will become a single non-profit serving the Ruby community.</p>

    <p>In the coming days, Ruby Together (the corporation) will dissolve. Ruby Together’s board of directors, memberships, and other resources will be joining Ruby Central, where we will continue to support Ruby open source the same way we have been for the last 6 years. We’re very excited to be working together, with less confusion, less business overhead, and more support for the Ruby community.</p>

  layout_id: 2
  content_cache: |2+

    <h2 id="a-new-approach-to-documentation-ruby-api">A new approach to documentation: Ruby API</h2>

    <p><em>The <a href="https://rubyapi.org">Ruby API</a> documentation site is an <a href="https://github.com/rubyapi/rubyapi">open source project</a>, initially started by <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanicpanda">Colby Swandale</a>, and supported by Ruby Together.</em></p>

    <p>Ruby API received an exciting update recently: the core Ruby type signatures are being imported into the app. Eventually the type signatures will be able to be parsed directly in Ruby API.</p>

    <p>“It’s all about being able to offer a richer developer experience to people by seeing the exact details of each method,” says creator of the app Colby Swandale.</p>

    <p>The current Ruby documentation is written in code comments, and as a result is not always consistent with the code itself.</p>

    <p>This latest update eliminates that. Instead of method examples being written by humans, they will be written by a computer.</p>

    <p><img src='/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCZz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--4a41bf3d173bcb2c2a696b48181119dfbd27c137/ruby-api.jpg' alt='ruby-api.jpg'/></p>

    <p><em>preview of Ruby 3 type signatures</em></p>

    <p>Colby is excited about the ability of Ruby API to provide much more context about the return values of methods. For the user this means a better understanding of, for example, which arguments are optional and which are required, and which keys are needed in hash arguments.</p>

    <p>“By being able to infer the type signatures you can infer directly from the code. So you can ensure that the accuracy is a lot better.”</p>

    <p>With such a vast improvement to the documentation searchability on the horizon, it’s hard to believe that just a two years ago Ruby API almost ceased to exist.</p>

    <h3 id="the-ruby-api-story">The Ruby API Story</h3>

    <p>Colby was inspired to create the Ruby API app in 2018. He says it “was a passion project of mine but it was born out of frustration.”</p>

    <p>At the time there was no one reliable place Ruby developers could easily search for items in the documentation they were looking for. A combination of the large number of sites using generated docs and Google’s difficulty understanding Ruby documentation, led to confusing and inconsistent search results. Often a search of the documentation would return several outdated or irrelevant versions of Ruby.</p>

    <p>On the sites that were available (https://www.ruby-lang.org, Rubydoc.org  and API doc) the UI on mobile and tablets left a lot to be desired. Over two years, and four iterations Colby set out to create a solution — having varying success with either the search feature or the UI but struggling to have both operate well at once.</p>

    <p>Then, he had a eureka moment in a conversation with a friend who happened to be taking a course on Elastic Search. He did some research into the search engine to find out more. It turned out Elastic Search had the exact features he was looking for to improve the search, and provide the results he was looking for.</p>

    <p>“You could do things like give priorities to arbitrary values, so if you search for a method that’s in, like, a string, the core Ruby class would get the highest search results.”</p>

    <p>With a search feature that finally seemed ready, and a new found rush of motivation Colby got momentum to design a UI that was fully responsive on desktop, mobile and tablets. In early 2019 he shipped the first version of the app on Heroku. As a soft launch, he shared the link out with a few members of the Ruby community to test and received positive feedback. Then he posted the link publicly on twitter.</p>

    <p>The result was basically, crickets. There wasn’t much site traffic. “I think it was like, maybe less than five people a day were using it,” he says.</p>

    <p>Admittedly, Colby says he didn’t make a huge promotional push. He didn’t post about the app on Reddit, Hacker News or any other large platform where developer content often goes viral. Instead it was spread by word of mouth.</p>

    <p>After a few months of low usage, Colby’s motivation to maintain the project was dwindling. He decided to shut the Ruby API site down, leaving the project open only on GitHub for users to run on their own. He made an announcement about it on twitter. It was then he realized just how useful the site was to Ruby users.</p>

    <p>An outpouring of support came in from people who had been using the app. Users reached out to ask him not to take it down.</p>

    <p>Friends in the Ruby community shared their enthusiasm for Ruby API on twitter, Hacker News, and the Ruby subreddit. It was even added to the list of resources on the official Ruby documentation website.</p>

    <p>“People were very vocal, and that was a huge motivation,” says Colby.</p>

    <p>Ruby API received a huge surge of traffic that day. Importantly it confirmed Colby’s initial hunch that the Ruby community needed a new and improved approach to documentation.</p>

    <p>“They gave me validation that I was actually on the right path — that there actually is a problem, people know there is a problem and we’re all seeking for something better.”</p>

    <h3 id="the-future-of-ruby-api-and-how-you-can-help">The Future of Ruby API (And How You Can Help!)</h3>

    <p>Aside from type signatures, there are a few other features Colby would like to add to the app down the line.</p>

    <p>“I eventually want to bring all gem documentation into Ruby API,” he says.</p>

    <p>The most important part of the Ruby API story to him is how crucial it is to hear from users.</p>

    <p>From the chance conversation with a developer friend that spurred the app, to the community of beta testers, to the Ruby users whose feedback have resulted in some of the features the app has now (like being able to run code examples) — the app is what it is because of community support.</p>

    <p>“This is a project that anyone can help make better. This is a project for the Ruby community and I would love to have their input to help make Ruby API better.”</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems--bundler-news">rubygems &amp; bundler news</h2>

    <p>This month in RubyGems, we released new versions for <strong>Bundler <code>2.2.20</code> and <code>2.2.21</code></strong> and <strong>RubyGems <code>3.2.20</code> and <code>3.2.21</code></strong>.</p>

    <p>RubyGems shipped a security fix for possible malicious code execution from <a href="https://github.com/sonalkr132">@sonalkr123</a>.</p>

    <p>In Bundler, we worked on improving the seamless migration of insecure lock files by automatically dealing with them when possible instead of printing a warning and still installing them - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/4647">#4647</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/4683">#4683</a>.</p>

    <p>We also kept discussing how to improve the experience when bundler needs <code>sudo</code> access, making the behaviour less surprising or unexpected for our users -<a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/4031">#4031</a>.</p>

    <p>In June, Rubygems gained <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/compare/master@%7B2021-06-01%7D...master@%7B2021-06-30%7D">98 new commits</a>, contributed by 10 authors. There were 993 additions and 480 deletions across 231 files.</p>

    <p>As always, we continue to fix bugs, review and merge PR’s and reply to support tickets.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-api-news">ruby api news</h2>

    <p>We worked on RubyAPI’s frontend project to reduce clutter and take advantage of existing open-source libraries. The goal is to utilize existing libraries such as Headless UI, ReactJS &amp; Autocomplete.js, which provide a much richer UI/UX for users and lowers maintenance costs.</p>

    <h2 id="budget-amp-expenses">budget &amp; expenses</h2>

    <p>In June, we saw $18,659.30 in total income, and spent a total of $20,733.67.</p>

    <h2 id="ruby-toolbox-news">ruby toolbox news</h2>

    <p>Hey everyone,</p>

    <p>I hope this update finds you well! In September I added the ability to browse a project’s reverse dependencies - the list of gems that declare that project as a dependency - based on the RubyGems dependency data that I added to the Ruby Toolbox earlier this year.</p>

    <p>Taking a look into which other open source projects are using a library can be a helpful indicator when choosing a gem, so I hope you will find this new addition useful!</p>

    <p>In October I’d like to tackle a few topics I have had on my unwritten roadmap for quite some time but haven’t gotten around to so far: I’d like to gather and display lines of code statistics for all gems to give an indication of size and complexity: I’d also like to integrate with the Ruby Advisory DB data to display security warnings for libraries on the site.</p>

    <p>Until next time!</p>

    <p>Best,
    Chris</p>

  title: A Vision For Ethics In Open Source Software
  slug: a-vision-for-ethics-in-open-source-software
  layout_id: 2
  content_cache: |2+

    <h1 id="a-vision-for-ethics-in-open-source-software">A vision for ethics in open source software</h1>

    <p>Ruby Together board member Coraline Ada Ehmke has been working for almost a decade on infusing the ideas of justice and equity into the culture and practice of open source. However, like many, her journey in the open source space did not start there.</p>

    <p>“I’ve been programming computers since I was a kid,” says Ehmke. “In the early days, you know, source code was in magazines. You’d get your Byte magazine and you’d turn to the back and there was a source code listing and you would type it in, and that’s how you got the program.”</p>

    <p>To the creator of the widely-adopted <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">contributor covenant</a>, and founder of the Organization for Ethical Source, open source was simply a formalization of the long tradition of sharing software for free. It was a way to make programming accessible and safer for users. Over time, though, she began to realize “open, as an ethical principle, was not sufficient.”</p>

    <p>In 2018 large tech companies, including Palantir and Amazon, came <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/29/technology-202-activists-slam-palantir-its-work-with-ice-ahead-market-debut/">under fire</a> for providing data and surveillance infrastructure to governmental organizations in the US, including local police departments and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That year the Latinx and Chicanx activist group Mijente launched the #NoTechForICE campaign, including protests and organizing against the use of technology to facilitate human rights violations, including the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-report-reveals-squalid-conditions-at-migrant-detention-centers/">violent treatment</a> of undocumented immigrant families, and <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/amazon-hq-rekognition-ice-protest/">systemic racial profiling</a>.</p>

    <p>The powerful leverage companies like this have in the open source landscape was brought into sharp focus for many developers when Seth Vargo, a well known open source contributor and former employee of the Chef app, tried to participate in the protest. When he found out the company had a contract with ICE he removed his code from the platform in an act of solidarity, only to find within hours it had been restored. Even though he was the creator of the code and did not condone its use, he was left with no recourse.</p>

    <p>The incident inspired Ehmke to create <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev/">the Hippocratic License</a>, an Ethical Source license prohibiting the use of software that is in violation of human rights. These efforts grew into the Ethical Source movement and what is now <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">the Organization for Ethical Source</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/79282?token=tWqoDbEjuzxu1in9vlec-0sYyro2yxjCZXaro7jRpq6Hp_JVi-n-pTte0tWJirr0bOhQ_h4sRLyIedXbJT-k4Nw" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 12.50.01 PM.png" /></p>

    <p>A common misconception about Ethical Source is that it is solely about licensing, due to its origins in the Hippocratic License. Ehmke notes that this is not true. Instead, the Ethical Source movement seeks to create a culture around seven organizing principles, including “our work is done in the open,” “our community strives to be welcoming and just” and “our work deserves support.”</p>

    <p>Many of these values are shared with the founding principles at Ruby Together, where Ehmke became an early member of the board. “The Ruby community led the way in normalizing codes of conduct for open source projects and open source communities,” she says, “So I would love to see the Ruby community continue to demonstrate that leadership.” The Contributor Covenant, which Ehmke wrote in 2014 as a standard for Ruby Together supported projects, became one of the most popular codes of conduct in the open source community. It has been adopted by over a hundred thousand open source communities and projects including Google, Microsoft, Linux and Salesforce.</p>

    <p>Endorsement by tech industry giants did not prevent the code of conduct from loud criticism from those who do not align with its ideals. Both the Contributor Covenant and the Ethical Source movement received similar backlash, albeit from different facets of the open source community. When it came to the code of conduct, the major pushback was from individual developers. The Ethical Source movement has received backlash at the institutional level as well, with organizations like the Open Source Initiative declaring that the movement does not align with the practice of open source. Even supporters of the effort <a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2021/04/open-source-software-freedom-from-ethics/">appear hesitant</a> to adopt the principles, for fear of legal repercussions and enforcement.</p>

    <p>Ehmke acknowledges that widespread adoption of Ethical Source will not happen as easily or in the same way as the adoption of open source itself, due to the fact that they were created with different goals in mind. According to Ehmke, open source served to make source available software palatable to corporations. On the other hand, Ethical Source tries to level the playing field between the creator community and the companies that adopt their work. “It has to be a symbiotic relationship in order to be fair,” says Ehmke. As such, she believes these practices will become more widely disseminated as individual developers and communities adopt them, incentivizing corporations to do so as well.</p>

    <p>The Organization for Ethical Source has been developing tools and resources that will be immediately applicable in open source communities, so that Ethical Source principals can be put into practice, tested and more easily understood. “We are drawing on the collective wisdom and expertise of people from different parts of the world with different specializations,” Ehmke asserts. These include a former Mozilla fellow whose project focused on how indigenous wisdom can inform open source communities, an anthropologist who has conducted ethnographic studies on software development communities, and a member of the Center for Democracy and Technology who works on governance in digital communities.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, Ehmke says the Ethical Source movement is about “incorporating broadly shared values into the work we do, with the aim of producing better outcomes for the world at large.” Whether or not they succeed, she hopes to set an example for other organizations to follow. “And I hope someone else does,” she says, “because we just cannot go on pretending that tech is neutral.”</p>

    <p>We were delighted to act as fiscal sponsor for the Ruby organization as part of Google’s Summer of Code (GSOC) program. This year, the org was administrated by Ruby core team member Koichi Sasada. Read on to hear from two students who participated in this year.</p>

    <p>王新宇 Wang Xinyu, a third year university student in software engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai, contributed to an event-based profiling tool inspired by Google Chromium. The profiler is designed to help analyze Ruby’s boot process and locate the bottleneck. The aim is to deliver faster gem loading for Ruby users, and provide a way to analyze Ruby VM performance intuitively for MRI developers.</p>

    <p>The profiling tool won’t be delivered to Ruby app developers, but with a little bit of hacking, they should be able to use it to analyze their own C extensions.</p>

    <p>Delton Ding is another GSOC student in the Ruby project this year. His work this summer focused on the fiber scheduler feature released with Ruby 3.0 last Christmas. “People like like Ruby on Rails because its syntax… is very easy to use, but the performance of that is very bad,” Ding shared. The fiber scheduler allows programmers to keep the syntax of [their] original Ruby code, but get performance that is “100 or 1000 times faster,” says Ding.</p>

    <p>The project is still in its early phases, and Ding spent his summer experimenting with this part of the code.</p>

    <p>GSOC allowed both Xinyu and Ding to become more integrated into the Ruby community, and learn how to most effectively move their projects forward.</p>

    <p>One of the most exciting parts of the experience for Xinyu was the chance to connect with his mentor, Koichi Sasada. Sasada created the current Ruby VM (YARV). “I’ve learnt a lot Ruby internals and other programming knowledge from him,” says Xinyu. He also learned a bit of Japanese. “This is my first time to really touch Ruby… it’s mostly written by the Japanese team… and the documentation is English [laughs]… Sometimes I have to read Japanese… but, I’m Chinese.”</p>

    <p>Luckily his mentor is a Japanese programmer and was able to help with the translation. “It’s a little bit challenging to let others know the exact idea we want to express, but so far it’s okay.”</p>

    <p>A major part of Ding’s experience was also learning the communication process within the larger Ruby community. In particular he learned the importance of running his ideas by the maintainers of the code that he wants to change, before submitting a change request to Ruby itself.</p>

    <p>“Once you submit the whole proposal then people are trying to review it instead of discussing it. In that case then, yeah, there may be a lot of, like, vulnerabilities or something for your project,” Ding explained.</p>

    <p>More on Xinyu, Ding and all of the 2021 GSOC students’ final projects can be found <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4524421995298816">here</a>.</p>

    <p>GSOC just wrapped its 16th year of student software development mentorships. The program was designed by Google co-founder Larry Page in 2005 to help students retain programming skills during their school breaks, and learn a broader range of practical software development knowledge most easily gained through participating in open source projects. Ruby, Bundler and RubyGems have all participated in the Ruby language project for GSOC many times since the program started, and this is Ruby Together’s 6th year as the fiscal sponsor for the Ruby project in GSOC.</p>

    <h2 id="falling-back-on-our-strengths">Falling Back On Our Strengths</h2>

    <p>Here at Ruby Together we feel it’s important to find ways to remind ourselves that time is, in fact, passing and that we are not, actually, living in one, long, eternal year. In that spirit, happy belated equinox and welcome to the other side!</p>

    <p>We have officially entered a new phase in the year. Whether you’re entering the fall, as we are here in the US, or welcoming in another season, this turning point can be a good time to reflect on how far we’ve come this year, and how we’d like the remaining part of it to go. It’s a good time to review the goals we set out to meet and check whether they are on track, and if we want to make any adjustments going forward. It’s also a wonderful time to remember the importance of the work we do together and recommit to what we’ve been building.</p>

    <p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/79600?token=XizZEln-lOEwm3vEufeYRIARVOs9YqOnTn19IazFR8t-jO5qIS-7g6SLZfuQRFaaJcWf2XgDKzx_ySTuZBczwt0" alt="Fall_Leaves.png" /></p>

    <p>Since we started almost seven years ago, Ruby Together’s vision has been to serve as a reliable, reinforcing framework in the Ruby ecosystem, not only for the stability of the infrastructure, and vitality of the projects, but also for the wellness of the community. We set out to bring that vision to life with a two-fold mission:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Cultivating healthy open source projects</li>
      <li>Working for and with the Ruby community</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="cultivating-healthy-open-source-projects">Cultivating healthy open source projects</h2>

    <p>The first challenge when cultivating healthy open source projects is agreeing about what “healthy” means. At Ruby Together we’ve focused on a few measures of project health where we can have the greatest impact. The first is increasing the number of open-source maintainers, to reduce burnout and the other risks that come with having a solo maintainer on a project. We’ve done this by choosing to bring in more developers with fewer hours per week, rather than aiming for only full-time developers.</p>

    <p>The second is welcoming and encouraging new contributors with all levels of experience. We do this by making projects easy for anyone to contribute to, and establishing a collaborative, positive space for projects, with a clear enforcement policy. We also periodically do outreach, inviting developers who are just starting to become more frequent contributors.</p>

    <p>One of our members Stephan Kämper shared, “I find a healthy, helpful and friendly community to be really important. Life, especially in these corona times, is hard enough. As a friend (and contributor to an ebook project I’m running) puts it in his contribution title: ‘We all are being hit the hardest’.”</p>

    <p>Finally, when choosing new projects we strive for transparency with a publicly shared project proposal, evaluation and <a href="https://rubytogether.org/projects">funding process</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="working-for-and-with-the-ruby-community">Working for and with the Ruby community</h2>

    <p>You’ve heard it before on the Ruby official site: “The community that grows up around a programming language is one of its most important strengths.” We agree!</p>

    <p>We are grateful to be supported by so many members of the large and longstanding Ruby developer community. We trust our members and invite them to hold us accountable in a number of ways. Our board is elected by our members, and maintains <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/feedback">a public feedback forum</a>. We also set limits on the amount of funding that companies can give. These limits prevent any one company from having too large an influence over the the projects we fund and the work we do.</p>

    <p>“I value the idea that healthy open source languages, frameworks, and other foundational tooling isn’t ‘owned’ by any one company,” shares member Jared White. “A plethora of companies and individuals (and even governments!) is necessary to fund, maintain, and sustain open source software for the good of humanity.” </p>

    <p>Speaking of the work we do, we report to you exactly what we’ve done with the money you contribute in an <a href="https://rubytogether.org/news">update</a> we publish every month, and <a href="https://www.getdrip.com/forms/6239290/submissions/new">you can subscribe here</a>.</p>

    <p>Finally, we collaborate with other Ruby community organizations: in the past we have worked with Ruby Central, RailsGirls, Google Summer of Code, and others to support the work they are doing for the Ruby community.</p>

    <h2 id="moving-our-mission-forward">Moving our mission forward</h2>

    <p>A lot more is possible! The more we cultivate our community the more we can bring your dream projects to fruition.</p>

    <p>Member Jared White envisions “A ‘Ruby component’ specification of some kind for web frameworks. For example: GitHub’s ViewComponent is very cool, but it’s Rails-only. If there were a lower-level spec that VC could build on top of, in theory it would work in Rails or Bridgetown equally.”</p>

    <p>We welcome your new ideas, too.</p>

    <p>We’re grateful for your support over the years and we’d love to be able to grow and keep supporting the projects that Ruby developers like you use every day. If you or your company would like to help us do so, you can sign up <a href="https://rubytogether.org/developers">as a developer</a> or <a href="https://rubytogether.org/companies">as a company</a>.</p>

    <p>What are you reflecting on or revisiting this season? What would you like to see come together before the year is out? Feel free to share with us on on social media, and be sure to share this article too!</p>

  layout_id: 2
  content_cache: "\n<h1 id=\"the-new-ruby-central-and-how-we-got-here\">The New Ruby
    Central, and How We Got Here</h1>\n\n<p>You may have seen the <a href=\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2021-10-21-ruby-together-and-ruby-central-coming-together\">announcement</a>
    in our latest news update, or heard word on the street, that the boards of Ruby
    Together and Ruby Central have combined under the umbrella of Ruby Central. It’s
    a fusion that felt like a long time coming, and one that will make things easier
    for members of both of our organizations, and for our teams too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So,
    what happened to Ruby Together?</strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-even-was-ruby-together\">What
    even <em>was</em> Ruby Together?</h2>\n\n<p>Ruby Together started as a trade organization
    that paid developers to work on RubyGems, Bundler, and more, using funds from
    members. Members could be any person or company who uses Ruby, and the work they
    paid for was free for anyone to use. Over the past six years Ruby Together grew
    to take on more ambitious projects and give back continuously to the Ruby ecosystem.
    Here’s a little bit of our story…</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ruby-together-was-born-out-of-necessity\">Ruby
    Together was born out of necessity.</h2>\n\n<p>Back in the Ruby dark ages, everyone
    who worked on RubyGems.org was an unpaid volunteer. We were able to maintain this
    until… we weren’t. In 2013 RubyGems.org <a href=\"https://blog.rubygems.org/2013/01/31/data-verification.html\">went
    down completely</a> — and stayed down for multiple days — all because no one had
    the time to fix a potential security issue fast enough. When the security issue
    was discovered everyone on the team was balancing work obligations. We decided
    that whichever one of us was done with work first would be the one to apply the
    security patches. As it turned out, no one was able to fix the problem before
    the weekend. Unfortunately, someone independently discovered the security issue
    and used it to hack the RubyGems.org server.\L</p>\n\n<p><strong>The week that
    followed was a very bad week.</strong> Multiple people who worked on RubyGems.org
    took unexpected time off from their paid jobs. We had to create completely new
    servers from scratch. We also had to download and verify every single one of the
    hundreds of thousands of .gem files, to make sure the hacker hadn’t replaced any
    of them while they had access. It felt like all the work we had done up until
    that point was a huge waste – and also showed us what a massive risk not having
    paid developers maintaining our systems could be.</p>\n\n<p>After the incident,
    André, who was working on Bundler at the time, began to focus his efforts on finding
    funding to pay developers working on Bundler and RubyGems. In late 2014 he received
    an enthusiastic response from Stripe, who was the first to provide financial backing
    for the cause. Engine Yard followed soon after, and in February 2015 we launched
    Ruby Together as a trade organization.</p>\n\n<p>In the years that have followed,
    we’ve funded the ongoing maintenance of Bundler and RubyGems, and managed to prevent
    any incidents of server downtime from occurring. On top of that, our members’
    support has allowed us to expand our funded projects beyond infrastructure maintenance,
    making it possible to fund projects like <a href=\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/\">Ruby
    Toolbox</a>, <a href=\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2021-07-01-a-new-approach-to-documentation-ruby-api\">Ruby
    API</a>, and <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/simplecov/versions/0.21.2\">SimpleCov</a>,
    and programs like <a href=\"https://rubyme.org/\">RubyMe</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We’ve
    also reached some huge milestones:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>there are now over
    175,000 gems (up from 101,000)</li>\n  <li>there are over 1,216,000 versions of
    gems (up from 583,000)</li>\n  <li>we have served 64 billion (!) gem downloads
    (up from 4.5 billion in 2015)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and made several other <a href=\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2020-12-15-five-things-to-be-grateful-for-in-the-ruby-together-community\">accomplishments</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve
    done all this while upholding <a href=\"https://www.contributor-covenant.org/\">values</a>
    that support the wellness of the Ruby community.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"but-there-was-an-ongoing-dilemma\">But
    there was an ongoing dilemma…</h2>\n\n<p>While we were carrying out our mission
    in more ways than we could have imagined when we started, \nRuby users were confusing
    the mission and purpose of Ruby Together with that of Ruby Central. It was already
    an uphill battle to obtain support from companies for Ruby Together’s infrastructure-related
    open source work, as it’s work that is mostly invisible and has historically been
    done for free. The confusion between our two organizations only added to that
    challenge.</p>\n\n<p>To try to address this, Ruby Together board member Jonan
    Scheffler put forward a vision of a single Ruby non-profit, and worked hard to
    get everyone on both boards engaged with that idea. Although at first there was
    some hesitation, it began to feel more and more like the right choice as the pandemic
    spurred Ruby Together towards new methods of community outreach and motivated
    Ruby Central to develop a membership program. Ultimately, both boards were able
    to hash out the details in a way everyone felt was a great fit.</p>\n\n<p>We’re
    very happy to continue carrying out our original mission as a new organization
    that is still aligned with Ruby Together’s values.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-whats-next\">So,
    what’s next?</h2>\n\n<p>For Ruby Together members, your membership will continue
    to support the same work. We’ll continue to support paid development work on Bundler
    and RubyGems, and we will continue to fund other Ruby projects whenever we have
    funding to do so. You’ll still be able to connect with us in the ways that you
    were, and your Ruby Together membership will be transferred to the Ruby Central
    membership system automatically.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Ruby Central is launching
    a new membership program that will eventually include newsletters, virtual events,
    a dedicated Slack workspace, early registration and discounted tickets to our
    conferences. For corporate members, we plan to provide support with building brand
    awareness, and access to resources, people, and events.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is
    to grow our membership program and be the main hub for all Ruby programmers and
    institutions.</p>\n\n<p>We know that combining the <a href=\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2021-10-18-staying-the-course\">mission</a>
    of Ruby Together to financially support developers, with the immense value Ruby
    Central conferences provide our community, will only make us stronger. We look
    forward to continuing with you on this next chapter of our journey.</p>\n\n<p>We’re
    excited to hear back from you! If you’re a member and have any questions or feedback
    at all about this transition, please <a href=\"mailto:hello@rubytogether.org\">reach
    out to us</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not a member, you can connect with us on <a
    href=\"https://twitter.com/rubycentralorg\">twitter</a>, or send us an <a href=\"mailto:hello@rubytogether.org\">email</a>
    and let us know what you think!</p>\n\n\n"

    <p>On top of those companies, 3 new developers signed up as members, including Naechrr and whysthatso. In total, we were supported by 124 developer members. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>

    <h2 id="rubygems--bundler-news">rubygems &amp; bundler news</h2>

    <p>This month, we released new versions for RubyGems <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3231--2021-11-08">3.2.31</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3232--2021-11-23">3.2.32</a>, and Bundler <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#2231-november-8-2021">2.2.31</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#2232-november-23-2021">2.2.32</a>.</p>

    <p>Here are a few of the more interesting changes from those versions of RubyGems and Bundler. As always, see the changelogs for complete details.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>fixed a <code>gem fetch</code> vs. <code>gem install</code> inconsistency about platform-specific gems - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5037">#5037</a>.</li>

  title: RailsConf On Tracks

    <h1 id="railsconf-on-tracks">RailsConf on Tracks</h1>

    <p>If you’re looking for a curated conference experience this year, you can allow the RailsConf 2022 program committee to choose your adventure and sit back and enjoy your journey through the conference via a track.</p>

    <p>The conference tracks are listed on the program and can be chosen up until the moment the first session starts. If you do select a track, there’s no obligation to stay on it. You’re free to move between tracks, move in and out of a track, or start on a track and then move on to general talks if you’d like.</p>

    <p>Or, “there’s always the hallway track,” as RailsConf 2022 program committee member Aisha Blake puts it.</p>

    <p>But if you do decide to stick to a track through the entirety of the conference, you’re in for a treat. The talks in each track aren’t simply grouped together by category, their sequence is considered and intentional.</p>

    <p>“The talks are ordered,” RailsConf 2022 program co-chair Max Tiu explains, “and narratives are crafted.” As a result, “you get more of a cohesive experience around an area of interest.”</p>

    <p>You may still be wondering: “Should I choose a conference track? And if so, which one?” Well, you’re in luck! I connected with the program committee curating this year’s tracks to ask why they chose each talk, and what to look forward to from each track. Read on to get a closer view of the RailsConf 2022 tracks…</p>

    <h3 id="make-a-switch">Make a switch</h3>

    <p>“What if you made a radical shift?” poses Brittany Martin, an Engineering Manager and cohost of the Ruby on Rails Podcast. She curated the “Make a Switch” track, which is officially described as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The track for the ambitious speakers who made a switch and the lessons they learned along the way. Left React for Hotwire? Refocused from logging to telemetry? In-sourced what you out-sourced? Bring your radical tooling, workflow and approach changes to this track.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>“As a podcaster, I love storytelling so I was excited to craft a track where developers like us could share the ambitious risks they took and the technical takeaways.”</p>

    <p>Martin anticipates that this track may lead to an “aha” moment for those who choose it, and she encourages teams to attend talks together, especially if they are relevant to your stack.</p>

    <p>This track is ideal for developers at all levels who have influence over technical and process decisions on their team.</p>

    <p>Martin encourages potential attendees with the reminder that “even if the subject in not in your wheelhouse (i.e. Frontend or DevOps tooling), you are not only attending for yourself but for your colleagues and friends.”</p>

    <p>Interest piqued? Here are <a href="https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#track-make-a-switch">the talks in the Make a Switch track</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="explain-it-like-im-five">Explain It Like I’m Five</h3>

    <p>If you’re seeking a crash course on some of the most fundamental concepts in Rails, “Explain It Like I’m Five” (or ELIF) is your perfect lane.</p>

    <p>Software engineer Emily Giurleo organized this track. Like the popular subreddit, she hopes it will serve as a welcoming space for conference goers to get a breakdown of core concepts, tools and skills that may seem complicated on the surface.</p>

    <p>“Too often, people think that certain concepts are too advanced for them to understand. I wanted to show that there is no such thing as ‘too advanced’ – with the right framing, any of us can understand concepts usually reserved for experts,” Giurleo explains.</p>

    <p>She believes this track will appeal to developers at different levels for different reasons. For beginner and mid-level developers these talks will offer a chance to move toward mastery of the Ruby on Rails framework. Meanwhile, experienced developers will be able to sharpen their skills when it comes to communicating advanced topics in an approachable way.</p>

    <p>If you’re looking to go in depth on specific topics, this track is not for you. Giurleo explains, “While the talks on this track do cover advanced topics, they are meant to serve as an entry point.”</p>

    <p>Get started on a new concept with <a href="https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#track-explain-it-like-i-m-five">the talks in the Explain It Like I’m Five track</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="open-source-maintenance">Open Source Maintenance </h3>

    <p>“There is no harder maintenance case than ‘thousands of people already use this and the core team is distributed all over the world working at different companies,’” says Chelsea Troy, Mozilla Staff Software Engineer and the curator of the Open Source Maintenance Track.</p>

    <p>And yet according to Troy, most new developers are steered toward learning how to build something from scratch. “That’s almost never the case we’re talking about in the professional world,” she says.</p>

    <p>As an educator, Troy specializes in highlighting the areas of software engineering that are undervalued and yet essential in the day-to-day context for developers.</p>

    <p>Successful communication, versioning, and maintenance practices have been refined and standardized in popular open source projects out of necessity.</p>

    <p>However, Troy contends these skills are “useful for all (or most) dev teams to learn from and adopt—including closed-source, private, or proprietary software teams like the ones that send their people to RailsConf.”</p>

    <p>Common concerns like “testing for regressions, documentation, managing communities, and debugging” will be covered. Troy expects that the talks in this track will cater to a mixed-level audience.</p>

    <p>She’s looking forward to talks that offer an exciting spin on topics that too often go under-appreciated.</p>

    <p>Preview the lessons from open source in <a href="https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#track-open-source-maintenance">the talks of the Open Source Maintenance track</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="community-content">Community Content</h3>

    <p>Rubyists interested in starting or elevating their content, be it blogs, podcasts, tutorials, meetups, books, games and more, should head straight for the Community Content track.</p>

    <p>Curated by Aisha Blake, director of developer relations for Pluralsight, the track will feature experienced creators of both digital and analogue content for the Ruby community.</p>

    <p>“One of the questions that I get pretty frequently is: how do I how do I get started?”, says Blake about her desire to curate the track.</p>

    <p>“You show up and you see the people who are giving the talks… hopefully, you learned something, or you’re moved by a story that they told. The exciting part about this track is that you can start to do those same things yourself. You can learn how to leverage your own story, your own work, your own interests to kind of elicit that same reaction in other people.”</p>

    <p>Blake is passionate about the power of effective communication to “not only educate, but to excite, inspire, engage” audiences, and is looking forward to using this space to uplift creators and educators in the Ruby community, as well as help new ones get started.</p>

    <p>She is excited about the “Give Your First Talk” workshop in this track, taking place in the morning on the last day of the conference. She encourages anyone who is even a little bit drawn to it to attend.</p>

    <p>“Take the opportunity. Like, try it out. Go talk it through with people who are kind of in the same boat with you, and don’t be afraid to to put yourself out there a little bit.”</p>

    <p>Learn ways you can start creating in <a href="https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#track-community-content">the talks from the Community Content track</a>.</p>

    <p>Whether you choose to go with a conference track, or freestyle RailsConf 2022, we hope this was helpful, and has you excited for the talks next week. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

    <h2 id="countdown-to-railsconf2022">Countdown to RailsConf2022!</h2>

    <p>Welcome to our first dispatch from Ruby Central!</p>

    <p>We’re currently coming to you from our temporary home on the Ruby Together Blog. The new Ruby Central blog website is still being developed — but with the conference approaching faster than a train on high speed rails ;), we couldn’t wait to start bringing you content.</p>

    <p>Our first posts will be centered on the upcoming in-person RailsConf2022, happening in Portland, Oregon May 17 -19. The program schedule is live and can be found <a href="https://railsconf.org/program">here</a>.</p>

    <p>We’re ecstatic to be able to continue to gather live for this conference despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to do so safely, we are asking all attendees to please adhere to our COVID safety requirements. You can find them <a href="https://railsconf.org/covid">here</a>.</p>

    <p>To RSVP for conference workshops <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/railsconf-2022-rsvps-for-workshops-tickets-317806607117">click here</a>, and make sure to check out and RSVP to our official social events (<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/railsconf-2022-rsvps-for-official-railsconf-social-events-tickets-317317534287">here</a>) if you can!</p>

    <p>Stay tuned to this space for more on the upcoming conference. Your blogger is not a tech industry expert and I’m excited to bring a fresh perspective and a focus on “the basics” to these posts. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2 id="railsconf2022-speaker-spotlight-a-tech-outsiders-picks">RailsConf2022 Speaker Spotlight: A Tech outsider’s picks</h2>

    <p>RailsConf2022 boasts an exciting variety of tracks and talks that highlight the creativity and interdisciplinary nature of the Ruby community. As a tech sector newcomer, I thought it would be fun to curate a series highlighting talks that immediately captured my curiosity, and get to know their respective speakers a little better. Read on for today’s speaker spotlight…</p>

    <h3 id="title-of-talk">Title of Talk:</h3>
    <p>Computer science you might (not) want to know</p>

    <h3 id="speaker">Speaker:</h3>
    <p>Andy Andrea</p>

    <p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/80757?token=zwYKUFjM9CWC0zaC6TzqFma_GfJRUywjqtpsv3SqZtcJmBL3uiK-YJ_TL20YL_UUwnzoTkj5ePqylgaGaP7YzQk" alt="1642469857797 - Andy Andrea.jpeg" /></p>

    <h3 id="how-did-you-get-into-ruby">How Did you get into Ruby?</h3>

    <p>As I was finishing up school, I got lucky enough to land an internship at a great company that primarily used Ruby on their various projects. Since then, it’s been my language of choice.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-favorite-part-about-working-on-open-source-software">What’s your favorite part about working on Open Source Software?</h3>

    <p>Open source software is one of the greatest melting pots of the digital age: so many people with so many different backgrounds are teaching, learning and creating all at once, and the output ranges from useful to artistic to ridiculous.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-least-favorite-part-about-working-on-oss">What’s your least favorite part about working on OSS?</h3>

    <p>In my current role where the code I write one day is likely owned by a different entity than the code I write the next, it’s often difficult to figure out what sections of the code–if any–can be open sourced. As a result, it can take a lot more communication and effort to write open source code than it does to stick with the status quo and leave everything in a private repo.</p>

    <h3 id="what-inspired-you-to-give-this-talk">What inspired you to give this talk?</h3>

    <p>I’m a huge believer that anyone can be a great dev regardless of their background if they’re given the right resources, so it’s always frustrating to see any needless barriers thrown up that make getting a career in software development harder or more discouraging. One such barrier is the sentiment that a formal degree in computer science is needed to be a great developer. I hope to show the flaws in this belief by demonstrating that even some of the topics in computer science that can be handy to know as developers are often not terribly relevant to the day-to-day problems that we encounter.</p>

    <h3 id="what-do-you-want-people-to-take-away-from-it">What do you want people to take away from it?</h3>

    <p>I hope that everyone will pick up some good tips and tricks to inform their software development strategies and to better understand some of the problems they encounter, but I also hope to show that a formal computer science education is just one valid path among infinitely many that lead to becoming a talented software developer.</p>

    <h3 id="what-are-you-most-looking-forward-to-at-this-conference">What are you most looking forward to at this conference?</h3>

    <p>I love learning and meeting smart and caring people; in my experience, the Ruby community is great at providing both.</p>

    <h3 id="do-you-have-any-other-plans-in-portland-during-conference-week-that-youre-excited-about">Do you have any other plans in Portland during conference week that you’re excited about?</h3>

    <p>I always love to hike and wander around parks and other green spaces, and it looks like Portland has a lot to offer. As a book lover, I’m also definitely making a trip to Powell’s.</p>

    <h3 id="thank-you-andy-for-sharing-a-bit-of-your-story-see-you-at-railsconf2022">Thank you, Andy, for sharing a bit of your story. See you at RailsConf2022!</h3>

    <h3 id="how-did-you-get-into-ruby">How Did you get into Ruby?</h3>

    <p>I was looking for an alternative tech to rebuild my product, and found an online course titled “Building SaaS web applications with Ruby on Rails”. That was a match.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-favorite-part-about-working-on-open-source-software">What’s your favorite part about working on Open Source Software?</h3>

    <p>An ability to share my work/thoughts with others, making something useful not just for myself (or my company), but everyone.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-least-favorite-part-about-working-on-oss">What’s your least favorite part about working on OSS?</h3>

    <p>Lack of feedback when everything behaves as expected; you mostly hear from people when there are issues with your software.</p>

    <h3 id="what-inspired-you-to-give-this-talk">What inspired you to give this talk?</h3>

    <p>I realized that since the Rails 7 and Hotwire release, more and more people started asking me similar questions on how to properly design real-time features (chats or whatever).
    After yet another conversation I just sat down and wrote the outline of the talk.</p>

    <h3 id="what-do-you-want-people-to-take-away-from-it">What do you want people to take away from it?</h3>

    <p>The answers. The solutions. The understanding that simply dropping Hotwire/Action Cable to the stack and using awesome Rails abstractions is not enough, you should do a paradigm shift.</p>

    <h3 id="what-are-you-most-looking-forward-to-at-this-conference">What are you most looking forward to at this conference?</h3>

    <p>Finally meeting people of meat and bones, of course.</p>

    <h3 id="do-you-have-any-other-plans-in-portland-during-conference-week-that-youre-excited-about">Do you have any other plans in Portland during conference week that you’re excited about?</h3>

    <p>Unfortunately, I’m coming only for the conference. I plan to get around the city, learn as much as possible about it and its surroundings to come back later with my family.</p>

    <h3 id="thank-you-vladimir-for-sharing-a-bit-of-your-story-see-you-at-railsconf2022">Thank you, Vladimir, for sharing a bit of your story. See you at RailsConf2022!</h3>

    <h3 id="how-did-you-get-into-ruby">How Did you get into Ruby?</h3>

    <p>My manager bet me that I could write a basic application we were responsible for in Rails, when I had no prior experience with either Ruby or Rails, faster than I could using our existing Java toolchain. I took him up on it, and I’ve never looked back.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-favorite-part-about-working-on-open-source-software">What’s your favorite part about working on Open Source Software?</h3>

    <p>Learning from the contributions of others.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-least-favorite-part-about-working-on-oss">What’s your least favorite part about working on OSS?</h3>

    <p>Figuring out how to sustainably contribute in a productive way.</p>

    <h3 id="what-inspired-you-to-give-this-talk">What inspired you to give this talk?</h3>

    <p>I thought it might be funny to come clean about some real things I had to search for recently to successfully do my job. Then the Program Committee selected my talk, and it got less funny - but hopefully people still enjoy it.</p>

    <h3 id="what-do-you-want-people-to-take-away-from-it">What do you want people to take away from it?</h3>

    <p>We have a lot of tools at our disposal to do our jobs, and searching for external knowledge is one of them. That doesn’t mean it’s one we should reach for all the time, but when we do, we should do so intentionally. If we understand <em>why</em> we’re using the tool of search, we can better control the strategies we take to get the resolution we want. It doesn’t always work out that way, but that small amount of pre-work can save you some time in the end - or at least put you in the right frame of mind.</p>

    <h3 id="what-are-you-most-looking-forward-to-at-this-conference">What are you most looking forward to at this conference?</h3>

    <p>Reconnecting with old friends and meeting some in person for the first time.</p>

    <h3 id="do-you-have-any-other-plans-in-portland-during-conference-week-that-youre-excited-about">Do you have any other plans in Portland during conference week that you’re excited about?</h3>

    <p>If my plane is on time, I’ll have all day Monday to explore the city, but have no plans. I’ve never been to Portland before - I’ll accept any tips or suggestions!</p>

    <h3 id="how-did-you-get-into-ruby">How Did you get into Ruby?</h3>

    <p>I came from acting/arts and not from computer software engineering. In 2008 I was working in marketing and moonlighting as a PHP software developer. From the outside, I was continually inspired by how many problems good software could solve. However, programming is such an abstract art form. For that reason, it’s hard to get involved. But then, I saw David’s video “Build a blog in 15-minutes with Ruby on Rails,” and I was blown away.</p>

    <p>It was impressive that Rails could do what it does, but that the Ruby language was so elegant and intuitive - in Ruby talk, it was “developer-friendly.” I. Was. Hooked.</p>

    <p>Since that video, I got more involved. By 2011 I had started my first software development agency. Our company leaned on Ruby and Ruby on Rails because it’s effective and well supported. We didn’t need a degree. We didn’t need a certificate. We just needed a code editor. Within a few years, we built new careers for ourselves and found a path to a new life.</p>

    <p>I can thank many content creators for giving so much back to my professional life; however, nothing compares to Ruby and the Rails community. While I don’t appreciate all the strong opinions of David and others in the community, I can’t deny their impact on my life.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-favorite-part-about-working-on-open-source-software">What’s your favorite part about working on Open Source Software?</h3>

    <p>The community, and that it’s free. Money is a huge barrier for most projects. I understand why it’s important at some point, but for new people - going into anything - free matters.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-least-favorite-part-about-working-on-oss">What’s your least favorite part about working on OSS?</h3>

    <p>Nothing. It’s fantastic.</p>

    <h3 id="what-inspired-you-to-give-this-talk">What inspired you to give this talk?</h3>

    <p>The students of LEARN academy (code school in San Diego).</p>

    <h3 id="what-do-you-want-people-to-take-away-from-it">What do you want people to take away from it?</h3>

    <p>Never forget that experimenting, breaking, and putting things back together is how the best discoveries are made. Don’t play it safe while you’re learning. Get messy.</p>

    <h3 id="what-are-you-most-looking-forward-to-at-this-conference">What are you most looking forward to at this conference?</h3>

    <p>Seeing people. I’m an extrovert. Being around others is a big part of why I attend conferences. I’ve made so many friends in this community, and seeing them sans the virtual background is very exciting after two years.</p>

    <h3 id="do-you-have-any-other-plans-in-portland-during-conference-week-that-youre-excited-about">Do you have any other plans in Portland during conference week that you’re excited about?</h3>

    <p>I grew up in Portland, so seeing the city I love again. AND EATING THE FOOD! The best town for breakfast foodies.</p>

    <p>This month in RubyGems, we released RubyGems <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3322--2022-09-07">v3.3.22</a> and Bundler <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#2322-september-7-2022">v2.3.22</a>.</p>

    <p>The following improvements and fixes are also included in these releases (see the changelog for more information):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>added <code>bundle-console</code> command in Bundler’s documentation - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5901">#5901</a>.</li>
      <li>updated the Bundler metadata source code URI for accuracy in gemspec - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5896">#5896</a>.</li>
      <li>removed warning for old TLS version connections - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5928">#5928</a>.</li>
      <li>removed no longer needed <code>fiddle</code> hacks since RubyInstaller released patch versions to not load <code>fiddle</code> on boot - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5902">#5902</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition, this month we’ve been working on migrating Bundler’s internal resolver engine to use <a href="https://nex3.medium.com/pubgrub-2fb6470504f">PubGrub</a>, the cutting edge dependency resolution algorithm developed by Sass and Dart maintainer @nex3, and <a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/pub_grub">ported to Ruby</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn">@jhawthorn</a>. Our progress so far includes better error messages and several cases of dramatically faster resolutions. We hope to release this work soon.</p>

    <p>We have also removed the feature of auto-sudo’ing when there are not enough permissions to perform certain operations, because it could potentially run commands as root without prompting the user. The feature existed exclusively for the Ruby built in to macOS, but caused problems elsewhere. Since Apple has announced they plan to stop shipping Ruby with macOS in the future, it seemed like a good time to remove the feature. This removal will be released with Bundler 2.4.0</p>

    <p>In September, RubyGems and Bundler gained <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/compare/master@%7B2022-09-01%7D...master@%7B2022-09-31%7D">94 new commits</a>, contributed by 19 authors. There were 1,678 additions and 1,869 deletions across 161 files.</p>

    <h2 id="rubygemsorg-news">RubyGems.org News</h2>

    <p>In September, RubyGems.org saw several bug fixes and updates, some of which include the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>added <code>rake task</code> to migrate MFA <code>ui_only</code> users to <code>ui_and_gem_signin</code> - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3217">#3217</a>.</li>
      <li>fixed MFA status label on owners index page - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3206">#3206</a>.</li>
      <li>added a fix to include missing i18n API Keys - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3208">#3208</a>.</li>
      <li>implemented a fix to allow users to delete all scoped <code>API keys</code> on password reset - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3202">#3202</a>.</li>
      <li>added recommended <code>to_utf8</code> method when comparing certificates subject - <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/3197">#3197</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This month, RubyGems gained <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/compare/master@%7B2022-09-01%7D...master@%7B2022-09-31%7D">45 new commits</a>, contributed by 11 authors. There were 621 additions and 212 deletions across 65 files.</p>

    <p>As always, we continue to fix bugs, review and merge PRs and reply to support tickets.</p>

    <h2 id="railsconf-home-edition-2022-speaker-spotlight-a-tech-outsiders-picks">RailsConf: Home Edition 2022 Speaker Spotlight: A Tech outsider’s picks</h2>

    <p>RailsConf2022 boasts an exciting variety of tracks and talks that highlight the creativity and interdisciplinary nature of the Ruby community. As a tech sector newcomer, I thought it would be fun to curate a series highlighting talks that immediately captured my curiosity, and get to know their respective speakers a little better. Read on for today’s speaker spotlight…</p>

    <h3 id="title-of-talk">Title of Talk:</h3>
    <p>Leveling Up from Planning to Production</p>

    <h3 id="speaker-thomas-countz">Speaker: Thomas Countz</h3>

    <p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/80866?token=UDY7jrZI-ce4rRH2OE_TGVZ-DFkOQ5UApZlN1zkI8u4y8Li65oZFg2Dp482l0CY7xFybN25SzsEieA8Q8Xjeoeg" alt="headshot - Thomas Countz.JPG" /></p>

    <h3 id="how-did-you-get-into-ruby">How Did you get into Ruby?</h3>

    <p>I was learning how to code from books and resources on the internet. Originally, I was really into Python because I enjoyed the “There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it” ethos codified in the Zen of Python (link: https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/). Python felt learnable to me.</p>

    <p>Then, I found a resource called The Odin Project (link: https://www.theodinproject.com/) that vibed with the way that I enjoyed learning. It used a language called “Ruby” and taught a framework called “Ruby on Rails,” and that’s when I discovered web development, which seemed like a great way to enter the software engineering industry!</p>

    <p>As luck would have it, at the same time of discovering this thing called “Ruby,” I was working at a coffee shop where a regular customer would come in and work. I got a peek at their screen one day and… WHAT?! “IS THAT RUBY?!” Sure enough, it was!</p>

    <p>Not only was it Ruby, but the woman writing it ended up becoming my best friend and mentor. The story of “how I got into Ruby,” cannot be separated from, “how did you meet your best friend Christine,” because meeting Christine is the story of Ruby. Rubyists support each other, they teach, they get excited about expanding the community, they create resources, give back, and on top of it all, they’re wicked smart.</p>

    <p>Having her invest and believe in me is the inciting incident that lead me to where I am today.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-favorite-part-about-working-on-open-source-software">What’s your favorite part about working on Open Source Software?</h3>

    <p>The reach, impact, and community. Working on OSS, rather than only using it, means you are on the forefront of solving issues that can have a huge impact! I love solving problems and it seems like the larger the impact, the more satisfying it is for me to contribute.</p>

    <p>That being said, it’s not something I’ve done a lot of. Those who are consistent contributors are also often great community leaders. What motivates me most to becoming a contributor means giving back to the community which has given me so much!</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-least-favorite-part-about-working-on-oss">What’s your least favorite part about working on OSS?</h3>

    <p>The barrier to entry. I don’t know that there’s a silver bullet to this; maintainers can invest A LOT into getting people onboarded to contributing, but going from OSS user to OSS contributor can feel like a wide chasm.</p>

    <p>That being said, because it’s my “least favorite part,” I’m fiercely interested in finding out how to make it easier for folks to get started!</p>

    <h3 id="what-inspired-you-to-give-this-talk">What inspired you to give this talk?</h3>

    <p>As I became more senior, I felt the structures around me beginning to fall down. As a junior, those “structures,” were patterns of work that I’d been taught to use in order to navigate small tasks: write tests, ask to pair, read about code smells, develop good PR hygiene…</p>

    <p>As a senior, it seemed like there were no structures—no guidelines—for approaching bigger responsibilities. Everyone kind of just figured it out for themselves. How do we communicate about larger and larger systems? How do we look at a business priority and systematically know how to approach it from an engineering perspective? How do we become responsible for work that can span months, not just days?</p>

    <p>I had to get more comfortable not knowing what I was doing. Getting good at not knowing sounds like it’s easy, but it’s actually a huge responsibility! You have to admit to what you don’t know and make a plan for how you’ll reduce those unknowns over time. As I had chats with colleagues about this, it turned out that lots of them felt this same dissonance.</p>

    <h3 id="what-do-you-want-people-to-take-away-from-it">What do you want people to take away from it?</h3>

    <p>I hope that people will take away some practical examples of how to lean into unknowns, rather than shy away from them. Not only is it okay not to know something, it’s our job to recognize gaps in our knowledge and to develop a strategy for navigating them in order to get our work done.</p>

    <h3 id="what-are-you-most-looking-forward-to-at-this-conference">What are you most looking forward to at this conference?</h3>

    <p>I was really looking forward to maybe making a friend or two… As it turned out, I’d made dozens! Everyone at RailsConf was so eager to learn from each other. It was truly inspiring. I’m still riding the wave of encouragement and inspiration!</p>

    <h3 id="did-you-do-anything-fun-in-portland-during-conference-week">Did you do anything fun in Portland during conference week?</h3>

    <p>While I was in Portland, I went to arcades and coffee shops and diners and bars… it was never ending, but I wouldn’t have had it any other way.</p>

    <h3 id="thank-you-thomas-for-sharing-a-bit-of-your-story-see-you-at-railsconf2022-home-edition">Thank you, Thomas, for sharing a bit of your story. See you at RailsConf2022: Home Edition!</h3>

  content_cache: "\n<h1 id=\"reasons-to-turn-that-idea-into-a-rubyconf-2022-talk\">5
    Reasons To Turn That Idea Into A RubyConf 2022 Talk</h1>\n\n<p>In case you missed
    it, the <a href=\"https://cfp.rubycentral.org/events/rubyconf-2022\">Call For
    Proposals</a> for RubyConf 2022 — and RubyConf Mini  —  is live, \nand in case
    you needed a calendar check, there’s just under a week left to submit! Whether
    you’ve been preparing for this moment all year, or last month’s CFP announcement
    illuminated a gem ;-D of inspiration in you, now’s the time to crack your knuckles,
    take to the keyboard, put your best ideas forward in the CFP app and ship it.</p>\n\n<p>If
    you’re on the fence about submitting a proposal, you’ve come to the right place.
    We’re here to demystify the process, alleviate your concerns and share some words
    of wisdom from a few recent RubyConf speakers who are glad they went for it! Without
    further ado, here are your 5 reasons to turn that idea into RubyConf 2022 talk:</p>\n\n<h2
    id=\"youll-be-supported-the-whole-way-through\">1. You’ll be supported the whole
    way through</h2>\n\n<p>Turning your ideas into a conference talk proposal that
    is clear, fits this year’s conference themes and impresses the program committee
    can feel like a daunting task. Luckily, you don’t have to start from a blank slate.
    In fact, former program committee member Noel Rappin and veteran speaker Sarah
    Mei have created some of our favorite guides to help you <a href=\"https://noelrappin.com/blog/2014/01/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people/\">develop
    your ideas into a proposal</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/04/07/what-your-conference-proposal-is-missing/\">elevate
    that proposal</a> to make it engaging and polished.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re still
    feeling lost or would like some feedback on your work so far, another Ruby veteran
    Kevin Murphy has kindly offered his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevin_j_m/status/1552744656307458048\">support</a>
    and has even shared examples of his <a href=\"https://kevinjmurphy.com/posts/sharing-past-conference-proposals/\">successful
    proposals</a> to spark your imagination.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you have everything you
    need for a RubyConf talk proposal, but you’re nervous about what happens if your
    talk gets selected and you have to actually, you know, talk!</p>\n\n<p>We have
    your back. Whether you’ve never given a conference talk, never presented at RubyConf
    specifically or simply are not sure how to best explain your particular topic,
    once you are selected you have the option to be paired with a speaker mentor who
    can help you prepare your talk.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to get a jump start on the
    process, many former speakers have shared their experiences getting to the RubyConf
    stage too, including RubyConf 2021 speaker Stefanni Brasil who created a fun and
    helpful <a href=\"https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/public-speaking-tips-for-software-developers/\">step-by-step
    guide</a> to creating and delivering a technical talk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"no-really--we-got-you-heres-some-more-topic-inspiration\">2.
    No, really — we got you! Here’s some more topic inspiration</h2>\n\n<p>Choosing
    to submit a talk to be included in a <a href=\"https://cfp.rubycentral.org/events/rubyconf-2022\">conference
    track</a> is a great way to narrow down your choices if you’re feeling overwhelmed
    by this step in the submission process. Some of our most inclusive tracks are
    “Bringing Your Backgrounds With You” and “Hidden Gems.” Casey Watts and Elayne
    Juten, the program committee members who created these tracks, respectively, shared
    their personal reasons to submit a talk to these tracks.</p>\n\n<p>“Teams are
    stronger when you can bring your full self to work, and our conference is stronger
    when our speakers can bring their full selves. This theme is close to the heart
    of the Ruby community,” said Watts. “What unique perspectives do you bring to
    the community and the workplace? We’d love to hear about them!”</p>\n\n<p>Juten
    invites potential speakers to share about a particular gem (or gems) from new
    angles: “What gems do you love to use? Have you explored the internals of a gem?
    We would love to hear from you!”</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"you-may-help-invite-new-faces-to-the-table\">3.
    You may help invite new faces to the table</h2>\n\n<p>It’s no secret that tech
    conferences, like the field itself, can be very homogenous…i.e. white and men
    dominated, with not much variety in class representation. We fully recognize this
    and it’s why we created the <a href=\"https://rubycentral.org/scholarships\">Opportunity
    Scholarship program</a> and why we are happy to partner with <a href=\"https://www.wnb-rb.dev/\">WNB.rb</a>
    to support RubyConf Mini. It’s also why if you feel like representation has been
    an important part of your tech career, you can consider applying to speak a chance
    to welcome and build community with other Rubyists looking for someone like you.</p>\n\n<p>That’s
    what inspired Stefanni Brasil, co-founder and educator at hexdevs, to submit her
    talk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sfyVxjvew0\">“Perceptual Learning
    == More Ruby Experts?”</a> at RubyConf 2021. “I wanted to see more people like
    me speaking at technical conferences. I’m a second-language English speaker and
    immigrant,” she said. Brasil also tapped into the Ruby community for support.
    “I collaborated with other developers from WNB.rb and we supported each other
    during this process. It made a total difference in feeling more confident with
    submitting a proposal.”</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"youll-have-a-chance-for-your-skills-to-shine\">4.
    You’ll have a chance for your skills to shine</h2>\n\n<p>One of the common themes
    former speakers shared about speaking at their first RubyConf is that it was a
    validating highlight in their professional careers. From joining a roster of Rubyists
    who have made great contributions to the community, to connecting with potential
    employers who are actively hiring, “putting yourself out there” as a speaker is
    a wonderful way to confirm your Ruby expertise.</p>\n\n<p>“It was a shift to feeling
    like I have something to contribute, and that I’m able to be part of this community
    beyond just observing it,” said Scott Moore, Senior Software Engineer at Doximity.
    After he presented his workshop <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC0fO7Ggzyg\">“All
    comments must be haiku! Custom linting with RuboCop”</a> at RubyConf 2021, “One
    of the attendees told me they implemented the concept from the workshop at their
    day job,” he said. “Being able to help someone like that in such an immediate
    way was hugely rewarding.”</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"youll-experience-rubyconf-magic-in-a-new-way\">5.
    You’ll experience RubyConf magic in a new way</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve ever attended
    a RubyConf you’re likely familiar with the special environment created when the
    all of the ideas, innovation, and problem solving are focused on Ruby. “Often
    the technologies around web development are all mixed together with Ruby,” said
    Principal Software Engineer, Kyle d’Oliveira who gave a talk at RubyConf 2021
    titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LitTV2k_X34\">“The mindset of
    debugging.”</a></p>\n\n<p>“It is really inspiring to see what can be done with Ruby on
    its own. You can learn neat things about the language itself, or new ways to apply
    it that you may not have thought about before.”</p>\n\n<p>As a speaker, you have
    the opportunity be a part of shaping this experience for fellow Rubyists by adding
    your unique perspective to the conversations, and possibly changing the way they
    look at the language forever.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-bonus\">5a. Bonus</h3>\n\n<p>For
    those of you who can and do sign up to speak in Houston or Providence, this will
    be doubly felt. “I find being present in-person is the difference between listening
    to a conference vs participating in a conference,” shared d’Oliveira. “It’s easier
    to connect with people, randomly meeting someone, join hallway conversations,
    etc.” added Brasil.  </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-few-final-thoughts\">A few final thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>The
    bottom line is, you don’t need to feel completely ready to create a wonderful
    conference proposal and deliver a great talk. All you need is the seed of an idea
    and the Ruby community will support you the rest of the way. We’ll leave you with
    a final word of encouragement from one of our featured former speakers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
    \ <p>“Earlier in my career, I didn’t think it was useful to speak at a conference
    because I didn’t think I had anything novel, interesting, or even useful to say.
    I look back and I realize just how wrong I was. Everyone has something valuable
    to talk about that could be beneficial to others and the more we push to share
    as part of the Ruby community, the better we can all become.”  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>–Kyle
    d’Oliveira</p>\n\n<p>We hope this post has helped all of you CFP fence-sitters
    to take the leap! If you still have questions about the <a href=\"https://cfp.rubycentral.org/events/rubyconf-2022\">application</a>,
    please don’t hesitate contact us at <a href=\"mailto:rubyconf@rubycentral.org\">rubyconf@rubycentral.org</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Happy
    proposal writing!</p>\n\n\n"

    <p>Was a Java developer, going to a Java conference (No Fluff, Just Stuff) where Dave Thomas was speaking. All anyone could talk about in the hallway track was this cool new framework called Rails (version 0.13). Tried it out on my upcoming project at work. Never looked back.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-favorite-part-about-working-on-open-source-software">What’s your favorite part about working on Open Source Software?</h3>

    <p>The community. So many people working together, to make programmers happy.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-your-least-favorite-part-about-working-on-oss">What’s your least favorite part about working on OSS?</h3>

    <p>Also the community. Those parts of it that feel entitled to complain, demand, and belittle project maintainers while never contributing so much as a typo fix.</p>

    <h3 id="what-inspired-you-to-give-this-talk">What inspired you to give this talk?</h3>

    <p>Sweta of WNB.rb posted a “talk prompts” list, and one of which was “do you have a hobby or interest that informs your work”. I’ve been embroiled in a major house renovation for a while now, and what immediately sprang to mind was “What renovating an old house teaches you about upgrading an old app”.</p>

    <h3 id="what-do-you-want-people-to-take-away-from-it">What do you want people to take away from it?</h3>

    <p>Whether you are talking about an old house, or an old app,  those old things require maintenance, and eventually a coat of paint (or UI refresh) isn’t going to be enough and you’ll have to rip it apart to rebuild. Just be aware there are many years of other people’s hidden mistakes… waiting for you.</p>

    <h3 id="what-are-you-most-looking-forward-to-at-this-conference">What are you most looking forward to at this conference?</h3>

    <p>Seeing lots of old friends and making new ones.</p>

    <h3 id="do-you-have-any-other-plans-in-portland-during-conference-week-that-youre-excited-about">Do you have any other plans in Portland during conference week that you’re excited about?</h3>

    <p>Definitely plan to hit up NASA Space Center.</p>

    <h3 id="thank-you-lori-for-sharing-a-bit-of-your-story-see-you-at-rubyconf2022">Thank you, Lori, for sharing a bit of your story. See you at RubyConf2022!</h3>

    As A Newcomer</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rubyconf.org/\">RubyConf2022</a> is
    three weeks away, and for some of you planning to attend, this may be your first
    RubyConf, tech conference or conference in general! If you’re in this boat, you
    may be feeling a range of emotions. Events like these are often big (we have 400+
    people signed up for RubyConf2022 so far!), full of official and unofficial events,
    and offer an abundance of subjects to learn, and people to learn from — especially
    if you’re new to the field. They can also be overwhelming and go by quickly!</p>\n\n<p>So,
    how do you take it all in and make the most of your RubyConf2022 experience?</p>\n\n<p>Luckily,
    the Ruby community places a high value on including, welcoming and mentoring new
    members; and this is no more evident than in Ruby Central’s <a href=\"https://rubyconf.org/scholarships\">Opportunity
    Scholars and Guides Program</a>. Established to invite new people into the tech
    industry that would normally face barriers trying to enter; the program offers
    grants, mentors, events, and more to its scholar participants. Scholars receive
    complimentary access to a Ruby Central sponsored conference, a mentor (Guide),
    group events, and a built-in community of other Scholars and Guides to attend
    the conference and events with.</p>\n\n<p>We caught up with a few of the Scholars
    and Guides from recent RailsConf and RubyConf events, to get their advice on what
    to expect and what to prepare for as you navigate RubyConf2022 as a newcomer.
    Read on for their expert wisdom!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"oh-youre-a-fan-of-ruby-name-every-gem-or-imaginary-conference-conversations\">Oh
    You’re a Fan of Ruby? Name Every Gem! (Or, Imaginary Conference Conversations)</h3>\n\n<p>In
    the days and hours leading up to RubyConf you may be feeling excitement or nervousness
    — or anything in between. These feelings can be intensified by preconceived notions
    about what a tech conferences is like. It’s easy to build up a picture of worst
    case scenarios when you don’t know exactly what you’ll be walking into. The Scholars
    and Guides we interviewed shared their biggest worries going into their first
    Ruby Central and tech conferences, and we have a feeling you’ll be able to relate.</p>\n\n<p>“As
    a junior new to the entire industry I suspected that I would be quizzed with leetcode
    questions or would otherwise find myself in conversations that would require perfect
    knowledge of sorting algorithms or some new, yet obscure, technology,” shared
    Dana Weiss, a Software Engineer and former Scholar. “I’m a bit of an introvert
    so I was just hoping to make it through unscathed.”</p>\n\n<p>Ella Xu, a Software
    Engineer at Hack Club; and Caitlin Henry, Ruby on Rails Software Engineer, both
    wondered if the professional connections they were seeking would be easy to make.</p>\n\n<p>“I
    thought there would be existing social circles, or cliques, of people that knew
    each other before the conference,” Xu shared. “I was most nervous about how overwhelming
    navigating the conference would be, and about how easy it would be to connect
    with and meet others,” said Henry.</p>\n\n<p>For one Guide, a version of these
    fears played out. John Sawers, a speaker, entrepreneur and engineering manager
    who currently helps coordinate Ruby Central’s Opportunity Scholars and Guides
    Program, recalled the overwhelming experience of his first tech conference.</p>\n\n<p>“It
    was easy enough to go to sessions, but actually talking to the other attendees
    was very hard,” he said. “I think I only talked to one person, and he was hyping
    his JS library.”</p>\n\n<p>Sawers said he left the conference feeling like he
    didn’t get the full experience, saying he “felt pretty isolated.”</p>\n\n<p>So,
    how can you shift your focus from your fears to experiencing RubyConf2022 to the
    fullest?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hacking-pre-conference-jitters-get-by-with-a-little-help-from-your-conference-friends\">Hacking
    Pre-conference Jitters: Get By With A Little Help From Your Conference Friends</h3>\n\n<p>Well
    first, it might help to know that there will be no coding pop quizzes (as Weiss
    was happy to find out) – and if anyone tries to give you one, you’re free to walk
    away!</p>\n\n<p>Next, you can start by slowing tapping into the energy of the
    conference. Being around a few fellow conference goers before fully immersing
    yourself in the day’s activities might help you ease into the event.</p>\n\n<p>Henry’s
    nerves began to transform, “once I checked into the hotel the day before the conference
    started,” they said. “I was more excited than nervous as I felt the pre-conference
    buzz of the hotel lobby and bar.”</p>\n\n<p>Sawers intentionally changed his approach
    to navigating conferences after his first go-around. “My experience didn’t change
    until my social context changed,” he said. He attended his first RailsConf with
    his team and found that “it was so much easier to manage, more fun, and I could
    rely on more outgoing members of the team to start conversations or find fun things
    to do.”</p>\n\n<p>Kinsey Durham Grace, another Scholars and Guides coordinator,
    and Infrastructure Engineer at GitHub, similarly reflected that having a group
    to navigate the conference with made all the difference. In her case, it was the
    Scholars and Guides program. As a speaker, she joined her first conference as
    a Guide.</p>\n\n<p>After that, “it became an essential part of my conference experience,”
    she said. “It is where I can feel comfortable in a smaller group and where I have
    met my best friends in the community.”</p>\n\n<p>Sawers, too, says he now has
    “conference friends” he looks forward to connecting with after having attended
    several Ruby- and Rails- Confs. “I collected more every year,” he added.</p>\n\n<p>In
    fact, all of the Scholars and Guides agreed that the best way to navigate the
    conference and reduce your fears was to focus on making connections.</p>\n\n<h3
    id=\"the-social-butterfly-effect-making-meaningful-connections\">The Social Butterfly
    Effect: Making Meaningful Connections</h3>\n\n<p>You never know the ripple effect
    one friendly RubyConf conversation could have on your life – or at the very least,
    your day. So what’s the best way to get started? The Scholars and Guides we interviewed
    suggested a few different approaches.  </p>\n\n<p>“One of the greatest things
    was the Slack channel,” shared Henry. “This was a great place to connect, stay
    in touch with, and meet other attendees. From threads about making lunch/dinner
    plans in Portland, to discussing our favorite talks, to threads for the LGBTQ
    Rails community to connect, the Slack channel had something for everyone!”</p>\n\n<p>As
    an attendee you’ll receive access the RubyConf2022 conference channel a week before
    the event. The Scholars and Guides program also has its own Slack channels, to
    support members and connect them throughout the conference.</p>\n\n<p>Xu shared
    her strategy for meeting conference goers on site: “Don’t try to go to every talk/workshop/event;
    spend time meeting other conference attendees in the hallways and exhibition hall,”
    she advised.</p>\n\n<p>Another good place to start is approaching a speaker after
    a session you enjoy — they are very likely to be open to a conversation. “They
    love it (I’m a speaker, so I know),” assured Sawers. “They’ll always be down at
    the front after their talk, so go say hi.”</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, conference
    goers may strike up a conversation with you – in that case, you get to skip the
    hard part. As long as you’re safe and feeling up for it, take a chance to get
    to know them. “Say yes to all the opportunities presented!” prompted Weiss. It
    could be the beginning of a beautiful conference friendship!</p>\n\n<p>When it
    comes to working up the courage to start a conversation, putting yourself in the
    right mindset can start with acknowledging that it’s normal to feel a little uncomfortable.
    “Likely you’re out of your comfort zone just being there,” said Sawers. “Embrace
    that and make your self even less comfortable by talking to as many people as
    you can.”</p>\n\n<p>All of the Scholars and Guides agreed that overcoming this
    will be well worth it. As Henry shared, “the biggest thing you’ll take away, other
    than the exposure and knowledge gained, are those new relationships!”</p>\n\n<h3
    id=\"more-words-of-wisdom\">More Words of Wisdom</h3>\n\n<p>Aside from making
    connections, the Scholars and Guides interviewed offered a few more pieces of
    guidance to help first time conference goers make the most of RubyConf2022.</p>\n\n<p>“Be
    sure to set goals before the conference,” Durham Grace suggested. For example
    going into her first conference Xu intended “to learn about Rails features I didn’t
    know about before and be able to use that knowledge to make a meaningful contribution
    to an open source Rails app” and “to meet other developers and learn about their
    work.”</p>\n\n<p>It can also be as simple as looking at the conference schedule
    ahead of time, as Henry did “in great detail. I knew that there were going to
    be some amazing talks to attend,” they shared.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, as a conference
    newcomer, whether or not you are in the Scholars and Guides program, you are welcome
    to request a conference Guide. “If we have bandwidth, we will pair first time
    conference attendees with a Guide,” shared Durham Grace.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, mentally
    prepare yourself to be present and have a great time! “It’s going to be intense
    and very tiring,” said Henry. “Have fun and get as much out of the conference
    as you can!” encouraged Durham Grace. “Soak it all up!”  Added Henry.</p>\n\n<h3
    id=\"final-dispatches-from-the-scholars-and-guides-program\">Final Dispatches
    From The Scholars and Guides Program</h3>\n\n<p>If any of this is making you consider
    signing up for the Scholars and Guides program in the future (applications are
    closed for RubyConf2022 and the Scholar/Guide pairings have been <a href=\"https://rubyconf.org/scholarships#SG22\">announced</a>!),
    here are some encouraging words from the past participants, that may help push
    you past your comfort zone to sign up!</p>\n\n<p>“There was so much great information
    that the guides shared with us Scholars, and it was a great way to connect with
    others pre-conference. This helped to ease my nerves as I could ask as many questions
    as I wanted leading up to the conference,” said Henry.</p>\n\n<p>“It was helpful
    to talk to and walk around with other Scholars and Guides,” said Xu. She said
    this is what helped her the most with her pre-conference nerves.</p>\n\n<p>“She
    was able to introduce me to her friends and point me to good speakers so I didn’t
    miss any good talks,” said Weiss of her guide. I immediately had folks to eat
    lunch with and make dinner plans with, so I already felt like a part of the community.”</p>\n\n<p>“I
    can think of a lot of Scholars who got their first jobs at RailsConf and these
    are exactly the people we want to see getting a solid foothold in tech,” said
    Sawers.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s amazing how many Guides that have been Scholars before
    come back each year,” said Durham Grace. Hearing the stories of how the program
    helped them change their lives is so incredible to hear. I have met so many incredible
    people through the program!”</p>\n\n<p>We hope this advice was helpful and has
    helped set the tone for RubyConf2022. No matter how you’re feeling, know that
    you’re welcome and we’re excited to have you join us! If you haven’t already,
    you can check out all of the conference event info \n – including all the talks,
    the exciting lineup of keynote speakers, logistics and more – on the <a href=\"https://rubyconf.org/home\">RubyConf
